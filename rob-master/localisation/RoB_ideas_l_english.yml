civil_war_attrition_2:0 "Attrition of Russian Civil War"
civil_war_attrition_2_desc:0 "Milions of people perished in the Russian Civil War, which spanned over almost ten years. Russian nation is in shambles, villages are quiet and cities stand much calmer than before the war... "

###Central Asian Ideas

KAZ_triumverate:0 "The Kazakh Triumverate"
KAZ_triumverate_desc:0 "The Alash Orda is run by a Triumverate comprised of Alikhan Bukeikhanov, Akhmet Baitursynov and Mirjaqip Dulatuli. The three men are typically squabbling over small matters, and their personal interests prevent much good from happening in the Alash Orda. With this triarchy, the government has become extremely inefficent."
KAZ_overextended_state:0 "An Overextended State"
KAZ_overextended_state_desc:0 "Following our brief war of independence against the Russian Republic, much of the Western Steppe fell to our control, including the city of Magnitogorsk. Sensing oppertunity, lands to the south were also seized. Our vast empire is hampered by inefficent infrastructure, and the illusion of power is all that is keeping the state from collapsing."
KZR_freedom_fighting:0 "The People's Republic"
KZR_freedom_fighting_desc:0 "The Republican Regime is widely popular with the Kazakh People. Among our citizens, the nation has been known as the 'People's State.' Citizens from all across the steppe flock to our banner in the dream of freedom."
KZR_kazakh_war:0 "The Great Liberation War"
KZR_kazakh_war_desc:0 "Now is the hour! The citizens of Kazakhia must fight for our freedom! Death to the Alash Regime! Glory to Kazakhia!"
KYR_mountain_peoples:0 "A State of Mountains"
KYR_mountain_peoples_desc:0 "Wide support from the local Kirghiz population and extensive knowledge of the terrain suits to our advantage in the event of an enemy invasion. The enemy will have to sell their blood for every inch of Kirghiz territory they intrude on!"
TMS_basmachi_remnant:0 "Legacy of the Basmachi"
TMS_basmachi_remnant_desc:0 "The Basmachi movement during the Russian Civil War was widely successful, pushing the local Red Armies back across the Urals and to the Persian mountains. The legacy of the movement still remains to this day, with many of our major players havinh been a part of the movement."
TMS_junaid_dictatorship:0 "Junaid's Regime"
TMS_junaid_dictatorship_desc:0 "From the Russian Civil War, the local governor of Khiva, Junaid Khan, successfully took command of the Basmachi forces and ousted the communists, proclaiming the Turkmen National Coalition following an Afghan occupation of Bukhara. Although he is widely popular, an increasing amount of opposition has shown face to the coalition, citing behind-the-scenes corruption."
UZB_afghan_domination:0 "Afghan Domination"
UZB_afghan_domination_desc:0 "In 1925, Afghan forces crossed into the Emirate, occupying it and isolating it from its Basmachi allies on both sides. Although effectively independent, Afghan immigrants have increasingly occupied high status within the state, and Afghan soldiers guard every corner of Bukhara."
UZB_young_bukharans:0 "Young Bukharans"
UZB_young_bukharans_desc:0 "During the Russian Civil War, supported by the Reds, revolutionaries declared the Bukharan People's Republic. After a long struggle, the regime was ousted. However, the movement behind such regime, the Young Bukharans, still persists underground to this day, waiting for a moment to strike."
KHV_longing_for_independence:0 "Longing for Independence"
KHV_longing_for_independence_desc:0 "The people of Khiva are tired of being under foreign rule, whether it be the Russians, Turks or Junaid's dictatorship. Given the right oppertunity, Sayid Abdullah Khan may attempt to take his small Khanate back onto the world stage."
KHV_young_khivans:0 "Young Khivans"
KHV_young_khivans_desc:0 "Similarly to neighboring Bukhara, Khiva also experienced a socialist revolution during the Russian Civil War. The freedom fighters of Khiva have maintained silence for now, but should an oppertunity arise, will likely try to take back the Khanate."

###Siberian Ideas
IRK_irkutskan_militarization:0 "An Army with a City"
IRK_irkutskan_militarization_desc:0 "The Army of Irkutsk self-proclaimed a republic during later segments of the Russian Civil War, however, the military is still the only real force in the state. Extensive militarisation and the introduction of armor have brought the Irkutskan army to a respected position within Siberia."
IRK_monarchist_treason:0 "Monarchist Betrayal"
IRK_monarchist_treason_desc:0 "Irkutsk was the fifth of the Russian warlord states in the monarchist alliance, but secret treaties with Mongol tyrant Roman von Ungern-Sternburg have left our nation politically isolated. Never again will we bow to monarchist influences."
SFS_german_origin:0 "German Influences"
SFS_german_origin_desc:0 "The Sretensk Free State was established in the midst of the Russian Civil War by Central Powers prisoners of war. The main functions of the free state, including its army and politics greatly reassemble those of the old German Empire."
SFS_language_issue:0 "Language Issue"
SFS_language_issue_desc:0 "Germans aren't the only people in Sretensk. Austrian Germans, Hungarians, Czechs, Slovaks, Poles and Russians are also citizens of the state. Of course, while this provides us with a substantial manpower and morale boost, it leads to issues with the high command communicating orders to troops."
SFS_siberian_cold:0 "Siberian Cold"
SFS_siberian_cold_desc:0 "From our old positions, we were thrust into the depths of Siberia. Many soldiers are not used to the new inhospitable climate of Sretensk, and as such, deaths are widespread, many simply from the cold weather."
WFE_naval_influence:0 "Naval Junta"
WFE_naval_influence_desc:0 "The White Russian Pacific Fleet Military Government is obviously a naval-oriented and led state. The cabinet of admirals regularly convenes to discuss plans both on and off the sea, and even the most inland regions of our domain cooperate to fuel the navy."
WFE_thicc_fleet:0 "Oversized Fleet"
WFE_thicc_fleet_desc:0 "With the loss of Vladivostok, the fleet has had to relocate to the barely-passable port in Nikolayevsk. The inadequate infrastructure in the region, coupled with the isolation of the port town to our other major cities further complicates a problem that will only continue to grow."
WFE_japanese_blockade:0 "Japanese Blockade"
WFE_japanese_blockade_desc:0 "With Vladivostok lost, Japan has effectively barricaded our nation on every side. The Kurils, Sakhalin, Home Islands and Korea all prevent our navy from reaching into the ocean sea once more, let alone reconnect with out allies in the Caucasus."
FER_far_eastern_democracatic_beacon:0 "Beacon of Democracy"
FER_far_eastern_democracatic_beacon_desc:0 "While it may seem untrue on paper, the Far Eastern Republic is the only real democracy left in Russia, led by Russians. An influx of immigrants have fled to our state ready to liberate the motherland from oppressive regimes and military juntas."
FER_tacit_american_support:0 "Tacit American Support"
FER_tacit_american_support_desc:0 "Our nation has recieved recognition as the sole legitimate Russian Government by the United States of America. While their support is minimal, politically, this gives us a major boost over other claimants to the successorship of Russia."
FER_loose_control:0 "Emperor of the Wasteland"
FER_loose_control_desc:0 "Our realm is large, the largest in Russia during this era, in fact, however, our population is not. Outside the city of Yakutsk itself, lies miles and miles of nothingness. Only the occasional village every hundred miles shows any sign of our control, and many have not even realized the existence of the Republic."
JSW_siberian_guerillas:0 "Siberian Guerillas"
JSW_siberian_guerillas_desc:0 "Our 'nation' is actually a confederation of small socialist Guerilla forces. Of course, while this provides adequate defence for the large realm, the groups are at times hard to control. Yeniseisk may very well be in anarchy should the alliance collapse."
JSW_decentralized_communes:0 "Decentralized Towns"
JSW_decentralized_communes_desc:0 "The occasional villages within our domain are widely spread out, just like the guerillas occupying them. Of course, this makes relaying any kinds of orders or exercising any sort of authority very complicated for our nation."
JVD_unpopular_regime:0 "Unpopular Regime"
JVD_unpopular_regime_desc:0 "Our nation is extremely unpopular among the native Russian population. It is widely considered to be simple Japanese occupation both home and abroad. The Russian population constantly works against us in various acts of defiance, much to our dismay."
JVD_japanese_dominance:0 "Japanese Dominance"
JVD_japanese_dominance_desc:0 "To say our nation is as Japanese as Tokyo or Kyoto would not be an oversight. Japanese roam the cities, roam the countryside and take almost all higher jobs in government. The native Russians have been relegated to second class citizens at best, and traitors at worst."
