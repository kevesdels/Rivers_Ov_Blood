rob_super_event.1.d:0 "It seems that all order has been lost in Europe today as France is Engulfed in a Major Civil War between its Several Factions. In the West, a Pelekist Faction has taken several parts of France, meanwhile Paris is owned by a warlord called the "French Sorealian Front", meanwhile a communist faction, heavily funded by Germany, has taken the North. The french government has ended up split between a Democratic Faction heavily funded by the US, and a Junta led by former general Charles DeGaulle. God Save France, for it cant save itself."
