 bolshevik_russia.1.t:0 "Russian Soviet Republic in 1934"
 bolshevik_russia.1.d:0 "The Russian Revolutionary spirit was born in 1905, when the industrial parts of Russian Empire exploded in a anti-monarchist and socilaist revolutions. However, it was brutally put down, resulting in a wide-spread disdain of socialism, except the industrial centers of the Russian Empire. This spirit manifested itself during the latter stages of Great War. Russian Soviet Republic, the republic of Russian proleteriat, was born in 1917, after the father of revolution, Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the bourgeoisie dictatorship in Petrograd, igniting the flames of Russian Civil War - A war that proved to be disastorus for all sides invloved. Initially, during the late 1917 and early 1918, Bolsheviks achieved moderate support from the working class in Western Russia, and the reactionary movement looked unstable, and was being teared appart from inside. The Red Guards pushed to the South, West, East and North, decimating the reactionary forces. Despite the early success, the Red Guards, being a voluntary organization, quickly bled in the green fields of Russia, and the Bolshevik offensive stopped. Reactionaries got back on their feet, and during the fall of 1918, forced the Red Forces out of Siberia and Northern Russia. At the end of 1918, "War Communism" was instituted by the socialist government, forcing conscription and making an "Army-First" policy with regards to the social and economic spheres of Russian society. With the advent of 1919, Bolshevik Army was facing difficult struggles in Western Russia, being forced back by the various independence movements, and bourgeoisie forces. At the same time, they seized notable parts of Siberian railway. This success wasn't long, as the need of reinforcments in Europe stalled the offensive in Siberia. In July of 1920, an all-out attack on the West started. It is estimated, that around 440 000 Red Army soldiers died. The attack, called the Summer Offensive, failed miserably, and Tukhachevsky and Jukums got executed. This was the beggining of the stalemate, as similar offensives on both sides became a regular thing. In 1922, A reactionary offensive cut the Siberian units from the main Soviet forces, and reached the encircled White forces on the Northern Russia, who were kept alive only by supplies form Entente. At the end of 1922, the Bolshevik economy and army was in shambles, as millions hadby that point perished in the flames of war. By June of 1923, the reactionary movement had fallen apart, and libertarian socialists, disilusioned by the Soviet government, rose up in the South Russia, ultimately forcing the Bolshevik forces out in 1926, shortly after the death of Lenin. The new governemnt reformed the economy of the Bolshevik state into a market socialist one, and signed a peace deal with partisans in the South. "War Communism" was abolished, and the focus was layed on the civilian economy. In 1934, Bolsheviks stand alone...  "

 bolshevik_russia.2.t:0 "Wealthy Peasants disregard government"
 bolshevik_russia.2.d:0 "Starting with the death of Lenin and Peace Treaty of Tambov, New Economic Policy (NEP), was implemented by the Bolshevik government, and gained wide support among the civilian population. Any attempts by "Old Bolsheviks" to stop it were unsuccesful, as they gradually lost their influence in the Soviet government. NEP esentially liberalized markets, leaving only the most vital sectors of industry under the control of government, and others only had to abide the central plan. However, this change of policy created a new class of wealthy peasants and bourgeoisie. In the past few days, few of the most influential farmers in South of our country have declared, that the central plan is unjust, and thus, they will stop the transference of the grain from the next year onwards."

 bolshevik_russia.3.d:0 "NEP not only allowed private enterprise to exist in the rural areas, but also created a new class of more or less rich factory owners in the urban centers, who were allowed to operate under the control of Bolshevik government, to allow the industry to recover from the strong messures used during the years of Civil War. Last afternoon, factory owners from Leningrad and Moscow met, and afterwards declared, that the time of market socialism is over, and measures, closly resembling pure capitalism, need to be put into pratice.

 bolshevik_russia.4.d:0 "After the remarks by both the rich farmers and industrialists in the past few months, two days ago the richest of them met just West of Moscow. After hours and hours of talks, they came out with plans about formation of a new political party in Bolshevik Russia, to protect interests of the wealthy - something that was unthinkable just 8 years ago.

 bolshevik_russia.5.d:0 "Old Bolsheviks, called so for their unconditional adherance to principles of full socialism, were ousted out of power in a power struggle, after the death of Lenin, when more moderate elemets achieved support among the war torn cities and towns of Russia. However, with the recent rise of capitalist class, ideals of market socialism have begun losing their popularity, and Old Bolsheviks are gaining ground again. Just today, in a meeting of government officials, Molotov called for a "2nd Russian Revolution", which would destroy the bourgeoisie, and implement system of state socialism. The speech found support among a big portion of people present. Even more, he called for a total realignment of the Soviet political system, and groups of people supporting the fight against oppresive bourgeoisie have already begun organising... "

In the general chaos, no investigation is possible - it's rumored to be the work of both underground reactionary organizations, Anarchists, old Bolsheviks, Latvian spies or even Japanese agents. When confronted with the news, Rykov apparently retreated into his room, from which talks about resigning could be heard for the next six hours. "

 bolshevik_russia.11.t:0 "HQ of Vlaslovists Attacked"
 bolshevik_russia.11.d:0 "Created in 1928 by the war hero and general Andrey Vlaslov, the Socialist Organization of Revolutionary Veterans was originally intended as a common organization for veterans of the civil war,, but slowly became a personality cult of Vlaslov, which he uses to propagate his quasi-nationalist and authoritarian views. Despite opposition of more moderate socialists, Vlaslov portrays it as a true succession of the Leninist thought, and the next step for Russian people. The leading core of the organization has earned nickname “Vlaslov’s Group”. It has become a significant force in politics of Bolshevik regime, and is mainly supported by veterans of the civil war. Vlaslov’s group are strong supporters of militarism, authoritarianism and Russian nationalism, seeing the Bolshevik state as an tool to futher Russian interests. This evening, the main building of SORV in the rural Russia was attack by a group of heavily armed men, aiming to take out the leading figures of the organization.In the following thirty minutes, a firefight ensured, in which the attackers were eventually expeled from the building, and forced to retreat. Shortly after, the local regiment of Red Army arrived, upon reaching the upper floors of headquarters, the first report to Moscow were as follows... "

 bolshevik_russia.12.t:0 "Start an Investigation?"
 bolshevik_russia.12.d:0 "With the recent attack on the headquarters of SORV, a heated debate ensured behind closed doors of the Soviet government. While many officers have sympathies for the ideas of Vlaslovism, many believe it's better to leave thing untouched, not helping Vlaslovists to further their agenda, and to leave the group to die without their uniting leader figure."

 bolshevik_russia.13.b:0 "Let's just forget this..."
 bolshevik_russia.14.t:0 "Investigation Starts"
 bolshevik_russia.14.d:0 "Even with the strong opposition to the investigation by many of the enemies of Vlaslov, it has officialy started. With the first course of action being the investigation of the bodies and weapons found on the battle site. The bodies apperar to be relatively clean, so idea about a local chapter was put forward by the chief investigator. The weapons however, seem to be Kar98 rifles of Baltic origin, since Red Army doesn't have any of them in the active service, and private ownership of weapons is heavily limited. Already, the investigators are talking with the locals, and planning searches in the villages and forests close to the SORV headquarters."
 bolshevik_russia.14.a:0 "Let's do this" 
 bolshevik_russia.15.t:0 "Reactionary Group Uncovered"
 bolshevik_russia.15.d:0 "After a long and costly investigation, the security services found a familiy member of one of the killed. Upon founding the relative living in a shack not far from Smolensk, he attempted to escape, firing on the agents using an old Nagant revolver. He was shot in leg and captured. When inspected closer, it turned out he had a injury on the left arm, that was relatively fresh, and appeared to be a wound from bullet going through his palm. When asked about the attack, the man simply looked investigators in eyes, replying only with "Long Live Russia". After a few hours, Vasiliy Blokhin himself, the second-in-command of SORV, blasted through the doors, and asked other persons to leave him alone with the partisan. Apparently, for the next few hours, painful screams were heard from the room in which the man was kept. Shortly after midnight, Blokhin came out of the room, with his hands and face covered in blood, and gave location to the investigators. Location appeared to be an old, pre-war military camp in the forests in Smolensk. When unit of Red Guards arrived to the place, a brief firefight broke out with the partisans present there. 36 of them were killed and another 12 taken hostage. Reactionary group appeared to be inspired by the ideas of Anastasy Vonsiatsky, leader of Russian Union in Russian Democratic Republic. A flag of Slavic swastika hanged from the wall in their main building, and was teared down and burned by the Red Guards. The reactionary group is no more. "

 bolshevik_russia.17.d:0 "Vasiliy Blokhin, second-in-command before death of Vlaslov, has now become the leader of SORV, and the most important figure in the Vlaslov's Group. Ideas of Blokhin himself have been deemed "mad" and "insane" by both his comrades and memebers of the government, but at the same time, nobody has ever had the courage to tell him that personally, as he is widely feared for his sadistic and violent tendencies. Blokhin supports a radical version of agrarian socialism, total destruction of any forgein influece, economic autarky and ideas of anti-intellectualism. This morning, after hearing news about the investigation, he blasted into a meeting of government officials, shouting and swearing that the crimes of "traitors of the Russian people" will not be left unpunished. "

 bolshevik_russia.18.t:0 "Vlaslov Outraged"
 bolshevik_russia.18.d:0 "After hearing the news about investigation, war hero and leader of SORV, General Vlaslov, was left speechless, afer which he progresed into a total anger. Vlaslov himself apparently said that "One day, all these traitors will hang, no exceptions", and talks about SORV expanding their arsenal have been heard among the military and intelligence high command."
 bolshevik_russia.18.a:0 "Whatever." 
 bolshevik_russia.19.t:0 "March on Moscow"
 bolshevik_russia.19.d:0 "The morning was quiet and cool, and Moscow was still asleep, when heavily armed units of SORV marched into the centuries-old city. March was led by Molotov himself, shortly arrived at the main building of Council of People's Commissars. Every other government institution, media, as well as military and police buildings, were all encircled by the armed men of Vlaslovists. Later that day, every potential enemy and traitor of Molotov and the Soviet people was executed in a swift action, that spanned all across the territories of Soviet Republic. While the current whereabouts of Nikolai Ivanovich Bukharin, minister of People's Commissariat for Posts and Telegraphs, and Mikhail Pavlovich Tomsky, leader of Russian Trade Unions, are unknown, it's supposed, that they too have been shot in the forests of Russia. With the new dawn, it was a new dawn for the Russian Soviet Republic as well. Molotov, a strong supporter of state socialism, and idea of achieving socialism in one state first, is triumphant over his opponents.  "

 bolshevik_russia.20.d:0 "With the establishment of two confronting political powers within the Council of People's Commissars, political situation apears to be dire indeed, as the Soviet government is unable to properly function. The political struggle is tearing the country apart, and the people are still in a revolutionary mood. The next action will determine the histroy of the proletariat for the next centuries. "

 bolshevik_russia.21.d:0 "In the documents published by this day's official newspapers of the Soviet Republic, a schocking information has been revealed about the reactionary path of two important persons in the Bolshevik government - Lev Kamenev and Grigory Yevseyevich Zinoviev. Apparently, both of them were supporters of the liberal opposition in 1917, and opposed Lenin's view of the revolution. This information has proven to be widely controversial, and it has been requested by other officials, that they are both relieved of their positions within the government, and the public support has turned in favor of Bukharin and Tomsky. It also appears, that after the following move, both of them have been formally united, publishing an essay called "The New Dawn of Socialism", which addvocates a democratic, federal system, based on both market socialism and syndicalism. With the impeachment of Old Bolshevik leftovers, the victory of Bukharin seems certain. "

 bolshevik_russia.22.d:0 "Comrade Bukharin has been officially declared the new Premier of the Soviet State by the Council of People's Commissars! Comrade Bukharin’s support was without doubt, absolute; his promises of creating a powerful state, under the guidance of a new revolutionary ideology, known as Russian Syndicalism, were enough to convince the common Russian to support him, and guide him to the podium of the Supreme Soviet.

 bolshevik_russia.23.t:0 "Tomsky is executed"
 bolshevik_russia.23.d:0 "With the election of Comrade Bukharin as the Premier of the Soviet Republic, a swift crackdown on political dissidents has begun. Thousands have already perished, either by being exiled, sent to labour camps in the north or by being outright murdered. No one escaped this crackdown, including Bukharin’s old time ally, Tomsky. A well-known supporter of Russian Syndicalism, Tomsky was accused of treason and cooperation with reactionary individuals, against the will and knowledge of the soviets. Although Tomsky has admitted to his crimes, his sentence was not reduced or altered at all by the Supreme Court of Soviets, and was sentenced to death by firing squad. At last, 3 days later, Tomsky was executed, and was buried near his personal dacha, in Bolshevo."
 bolshevik_russia.23.a:0 "He got what he deserved."
 bolshevik_russia.24.t:0 "Discredit the Old Bolsheviks?"
 bolshevik_russia.24.d:0 "With the newly created Triumvirate, a new question has resurfaced in the mind of Tomsky - what about the actions of Kamenev and Zinoviev during the early stages of Russian Civil War? Only few of the people still present in the Soiet political circles still remember this, but at the dawn of Lenin's Revolution, both Kamenev and Zinoviev were strongly opposed to ideas of the great leader himself, even going so far as supporting the various liberal movements within the former Russian Empire. Something like this could potentially ruin their careers and leave Tomsky alone on the political stage. The main question now is only one - should the information be published in the press? "

 bolshevik_russia.26.d:0 "After information about both Kamenev and Zinoviev, the government institutions have been dominated by the ideas of Tomsky, as laid out in his work "Russian Syndicalism - The Next Step". Both the workers and peasants hold him and his views in high regard, especially after unmasking of both Bolshevik traitors within the government, and he has achieved considerable support from Soviet ministers too. Tomsky appears to be the rising star of the Soviet politics, and only something unexpected can change this now."

 bolshevik_russia.27.d:0 "Today, a mob of angry workers breached into a gathering of most important Soviet political figures, only forced back by a group of Red Guards, who resorted to using lethal force on the attackers.

 bolshevik_russia.29.d:0 "With the victory of Triumvirate, Kamenev and Zinoviev met today behind closed doors in Zinoviev's private house just outside of Moscow. The main focus of the talk was status of Tomsky, who both of them deemed undesirable , and only as a momentary ally. When the talk concluded, both of them separated their ways, and the course of action was clear. Tomsky needs to be exposed as a reactionary and foreign agent, just like Bukharin."

 bolshevik_russia.30.d:0 "On this day's Pravda, a big picture of Tomsky decorated the front page, with big letters saying "SPY!" just above it. The author of the text, Zinoviev, exposed Tomsky as a French and British spy, with the goal of destroying the work on socialism by the international proletariat. The newspaper sold record numbers, and Tomsky has been officialy resigned from his post in Council of People's Commissars in a unopposed vote.

The goals you may ask? To industrialise and modernise the Soviet people for a new, greater socialist future.   Of Course before we cannot start working on maintaining the future before fixing the past. The plan is called “The Five Year” plan, as you can tell by the name, its mission is to prepare the Soviet people in just five years. Thus action must be taken as soon as possible, and we must fix the past by destroying the bourgeoisie…”\n\nThis is only an excerpt from a speech by Premier [SOV.GetLeader], given in the red square right next to a mob of Soviet people. Our glorious comrade has already began to make much work on his promises for a better future for the Soviet people, starting with his promises to amend the past. Armed men were sent under orders from the People’s Communist Party to forcefully arrest landowners and give out their lands to the Soviet people.

Teams of electricians and party members walk in every village of the Russian Soviet Republic, knocking on every door to explain that they are here to make their lives better. Some people, especially the older ones look in awe as the electricians put in the lights and turn them on, but the campaign does not stop there, the teams not only install lights but also other commodities, such as the radio.\n\nWhile they are working at a great speed and done for the wellbeing of the Soviet people, but the premier is quoted of having sayed “Who cares about the costs if it improves the future of our people?

This is most seen in the capital of Moscow, which is now greatly expanded in all directions and has already swallowed many Soviet villages. Many luxuries are also built, especially in larger towns such as Moscow, dedicated to make sure the work filled lives of the Russian people are pleasant, yet there are some cowardly traitors claiming this is merely a stunt to get more people to move into the Soviet cities.

As general Budyonny insults general Shaposhnikov your patience finally runs out and you hit your table, getting the attention all the generals, - “Explain one at a time instead of bickering like children, you all are generals of the Russian Soviet Republic, show some respect! - The command suddenly quiets down after that, - “Zhukov, explain what is your idea how the Soviet Army should be.”\n\nZhukov answers in a stern, as soldierly as possible voice; “An elite force focused on speed, by the use of armoured cars and tanks. The entire army would be made to support them while they drive deep into the enemy homeland wrecking havoc among their forces.” You nod and turn to Shaposhnikov, and ask him to explain his view on the Soviet army; “An elite force dedicated on minimising casualties via the use of artillery. Infantry should be well trained as well, to minimise losses.” pleased with the response you turn to more conservative side of the command and say “Voroshilov, you”, to which he responds with some stress obviously visible; “The Soviet officer pool isn’t… The best comrade, we must refresh it if we want any hope in any suc”- He gets cut by Shaposhnikov saying “I think all of us want that, sherlock” before getting stared into silence by you. Voroshilov continued; “I say we leave the red army as it is but focus on our common soldier, modernize their equipment, their machine guns and focus on modernizing communication and recon.” you nod once again and turn to Budyonny, who seems to be smoking a cigar during the entire conversation, he responds in the calmest voice possible. “Simply throw more men than they have bullets. While arming them with guns, and yes even old guns, is a priority it is undeniable that victory will be achieved by numbers. I propose to reform the Red Guard into a force less… Elite and more simple, like the common man.”"
 bolshevik_russia.40.d:0 "As the evening approaches you get into your car and are taken to the HQ of the Soviet air force. In there, Alksnis, a bolshevik from Latvia and Novikov, your average Bolshevik soldier, along with many other important Bolshevik officials, await your arrival. You are met in a fairly large ceremony but soon proceed into the meeting room, where you are saluted by the entire room. You all sit down and start speaking. Alksnis, opens his mouth first,  and states in a confident voice; “Comrade Premier, we have called you here for a simple reason. The Bolshevik Air force is bickering among itself over the future of it. We need you to decide. I and Novikov as leaders of the two separate factions regarding the topic have both individually agreed to explain our cases.”\n\n- You simply nod, he then continues - “I believe it is of the utmost importance we focus on bombers, the air force is to support the army thus our goal must be to make the enemy to not be able to continue the war against us by destroying their factories and cities.” - He turns to Novikov and sits down. Novikov stands up instead and starts explaining; “While comrade Alksnis is correct regarding the fact the air force is supposed to support the bolshevik army, he is not correct in the manner of how. We mustn't make the enemy worker afraid, but we should focus on close air support so we can destroy the enemy’s columns as they try to move anywhere. Comrade premier, the choice is in your hands.”"
 bolshevik_russia.41.d:0 "As Premier Vlaslov rushes on top of a platform meant for speeches he shouts to the Soviet people; “Glorious Russian Worker! I, Vlaslov, announce that the pseudo-bourgeoisie power of old will be removed! The traitors who only cared for their pockets, but not you, my glorious Russian people. This all changes today, as I and my guard have destroyed the traitors and I announce to you, my dear Russians, that today is a new dawn in the history of the Russian Soviet Republic!”\n\nAs soon as he screams that, he marches off to the premiers palace and begins work, but not all are happy. Some, who are against Vlaslov’s glorious regime, have begun to protest against him!"
 bolshevik_russia.41.a:0 "All Hail the New Leader!"
 bolshevik_russia.42.d:0 "Vlaslov today met with various representatives of the Russian Soviet Republic’s various trade unions and Vlaslov talked with them for a good while before making a final agreement. Both Vlaslov and they are in full agreement regarding the bourgeoisie question and on market socialism, vowing to aid each other in their respective fights against both."
 bolshevik_russia.42.a:0 "A Glorious Meeting!"
 bolshevik_russia.43.d:0 "Vlaslov has promised a series of economic reforms, all of which have only one, simple goal in mind; to lessen the bourgeoisie influence. They’re meant to take their land, and turn them equal to the Soviet people or… If they’re particularly traitorous - to destroy them. This of course also comes with some new economic freedoms but in general the new reforms are aimed to support the small man, and not the bourgeois pig we started the revolution to get rid of."
 bolshevik_russia.43.a:0 "All is necessary to defeat the bourgeoisie."
 bolshevik_russia.44.d:0 "The Bourgeoisie and the Russian have always been enemies, ever since the start of history, for the noble Russian, he cannot comprehend greediness, he works for his people’s good and not his own, this is a quality the bourgeoisie cannot boast about, are they even Russian? Our noble comrade Vlaslov has launched a series of reforms to weaken our cowardly enemy, each hurting the enemy bit by bit. The enemy covered and responded back with equal ferocity but we did not waver, we pushed on and on till we have finally eradicated the bourgeoisie beast!"
 bolshevik_russia.44.a:0 "FInally the Soviets have triumphed!"
 bolshevik_russia.45.d:0 "The bourgeoisie traitors and their lovers are starting riots all over Russia and are starting to raise chaos despite the most noble efforts of premier Vlaslov. These men are brigands and enemies of the Russian state but we cannot deal with it using the needed ferocity they deserve, they outnumber the police forces as well. But this all changes now! Comrade premier Vlaslov has released an order mobilizing all his paramilitaries to keep the peace and punish the traitors."
 bolshevik_russia.45.a:0 "They will keep the true people safe."
 bolshevik_russia.46.d:0 "Under comrade Vlaslov’s orders element of the red guard are to be mobilized in order to deal with the traitors. The reason they are mobilized? The fact the red guard has remained loyal to comrade Vlaslov. They are given permission to open fire if the said enemies are a nuisance. So far only one traitor fell thanks to righteous action."
 bolshevik_russia.46.a:0 "I hope that traitors will die."
 bolshevik_russia.47.d:0 "Ever since comrade Vlaslov came to power these men were a constant nuisance. This changes now. Under comrade Vlaslov’s orders there will be an operation to clear the streets off these scum. Under comrade Vlaslov’s orders all must be either dead or arrested during a combined operation of police, paramilitaries and the red guard. The regular soldiers are ordered to simply keep guard and do not let any news of this event to get though."
 bolshevik_russia.47.a:0 "The operation was a success."
 bolshevik_russia.48.d:0 "Red Guard troops rush the soviet parliament in the middle of the night, many more are rushing other important locations such as radio towers, other barracks and the homes of major politicians. The men take the building with ease and raise the red flag on top of it. A few hours later a car arrives near a radio tower, out of which Blokhin steps out saluted by the men. He marches into it and declares he is the new leader of the Russian Soviet Republic. \n\nThe old leaders are already arrested."
 bolshevik_russia.49.d:0 "Blokhin sits on his chair writing something on a piece of paper awaiting for something, suddenly comrade Yagoda rushed into his office. Blokhin simply signed the paper and gave him it. “Pass it on to comrade Yakov Agronov, it is regarding the traitors”. And so Yagoda did it, the following day Red Guard soldiers and policemen went around to various apartments, asking for leaders of trade unions and arresting them.\n\nWhat followed for many of them was the death penalty, only a few managed to escape such a fate, but even then they were sent to the deepest prison in the Russian Soviet Republic. Such is the fate of those opposing Blokhin."
 bolshevik_russia.50.d:0 "With the trade union leadership gone, all that remained was to simply destroy the unions themselves. Blokhin, today has finally signed one of the last bills ordering the destruction of trade unions. Red Guard soldiers ought to arrest anyone who resists the bill, and also the higher ups that remain unarrested are to be executed."
 bolshevik_russia.51.d:0 "With the new laws some Russians, who are more traitors to the motherland than Russians , have marched to the streets to protest against Blokhin’s fully legitimate power. But this lasts no longer, comrade Blokhin has used his brave and loyal soldiers and policemen to crush the scum."
 bolshevik_russia.52.d:0 "Comrade Blokhin has ordered that the SORV ought to report to the nearest military base for duty. While this has received a bit of criticism, Blokhin argues it is necessary for the future of the Russian Soviet Republic."
 bolshevik_russia.53.d:0 "Comrade Blokhin has asked for his faithful loyalists, to join new military units used to deal with traitors and serve the motherland against all the traitors and foreigners."
 bolshevik_russia.54.d:0 "Blood fills the streets of Russia. Men are being executed in the streets. This managed to start some protests but they were all destroyed as the Blokhinists and SORV unleashed machine gun fire onto the protestors. The death penalty is given out daily in the court’s of Russia and the amount of people who need to go there is so large that guards are instructed to executed anyone charged with the death penalty on the spot."
 bolshevik_russia.55.d:0 "With the brutal suppression going around on the streets of Russia, Blokhin has declared he will wage war with “The old, reactionary Russian” to form the “new, superior and most importantly, socialist Russian”. The punishment for keeping old traditions is higher than some crimes such as theft, and with the brutal suppression it is only making events worse..."
 bolshevik_russia.56.d:0 "Blokhinists are marching across the villages, towns and cities of Russia, destroying anything that seems foreign, marking any house whose inhabitants might harbour any relation with anything outside of Russia with “иностранец” and often minorities are beaten on the streets. This is all thanks to Blokhin’s new order, stating that anything foreign must be wiped."
 bolshevik_russia.57.d:0 "At last, Comrade Bukharin has solidified his position as Chairman of the Russian Soviet Republic. His position is unopposed, all potential candidates and opponents either pledge their allegiance to the new chairman, or have met an unfortunate fate. The Cheka is finishing up the cleanup of filthy reactionary and revisionist elements on our glorious country, and the State Press proudly delivers the news to the Russian workers and farmers of our country, of a powerful  statesman taking power and ready to lead the country to the glorious path it deserves. In a recent radio announcement, Comrade Bukharin pledged his support for the common worker and farmer, and has already claimed that the road to Russian Syndicalism has began."
 bolshevik_russia.58.d:0 "Bukharin today met with various representatives of the Russian Soviet Republic’s various trade unions and talked with them for a good while before making a decent amount of promises and agreements. Bukharin stated to them that if they give him their “full unconditional support” he will destroy the bourgeoisie. Which they happily agreed. Later on seeing they are agreeing with him fully, Bukharin offered them to merge with the state...which they once again agreed to."
 bolshevik_russia.59.d:0 "Bukharin in a speech has detailed his plans for the economy of the Russian Soviet Republic, which mainly includes nationalisation of industry and more state control, despite this, Bukharin also promises for more social freedoms for the Soviet people. Important economic sectors such as the agricultural, industrial and many more are to be nationalised for the Soviet people. This is a new stepping stone for the Soviet people"
 bolshevik_russia.60.d:0 "Soviet police lead Russian civilians home, the strikes are finally fading away. Bukharin had strictly ordered the police to avoid violence “at any cost” and pursued a non violent solution to the problem, which has led to a diplomatic solution. The protestors are let free without any social or economic discrimination."
 bolshevik_russia.61.d:0 "Police officers have been ordered to arrive in various locations, their job - to deal with the unrest. They are advised once again to use as little amount of violence as possible. Despite this they are armed. They are also given extra authority."
 bolshevik_russia.62.d:0 "Soviet civilians all over the Russian Soviet Republic are being granted various weapons free of charge, the only thing needed for application is simple; a proven loyalty to Bukharin and the soviet state. This is also met with a massive liberalisation of Soviet gun laws, allowing open carry for many. State sponsored shooting ranges are being built all over the Russian Soviet Republic."
 bolshevik_russia.63.d:0 "The streets are finally clear of protesting civilians and the prisons are being filled with the leadership of said protests. Bukharin has finally won over thanks to his pacifistic policy and new reforms in the Russian Soviet Republic."
 bolshevik_russia.64.d:0 "Our glorious premier Bukharin has passed a law which severely reforms the lives of our dear soviet citizens. Firstly the people may now insult or criticize communist party members, they can say whatever they want and generally have more liberties. They can finally chose if they want to take part in some events or not, which has sadly lowered participation in several events but if this is the cost for a happy populace then so be it."
 bolshevik_russia.65.d:0 ""Comrades, is the revolution only a matter of pure economics, or should we fight injustice whereever we find it?"\n\nWith such words, Premier Bukharin opened one of his speeched in front of government officials today. As the economic situation has become more stable in recent months, and Bukharins control over country secured, he has begun a series of reforms sweeping through Russian lands. Bukharin has promised, that Russia won't stay a backwards place, full of discrimination, but will abolish these structures instead. Already, such concepts as "marriage" and "sexual decency" have been completely abolished. It is also true, that under Bukharin's leadership, reforms are being made, to finally legalize things such as homosexuality. Already praised by many liberal and communist thinkers alike, while most of opposition, that being the rural populace, is being ignored at best, and swiftly executed at worst. \n\nWith the on going reforms, the Bolshevik government has even invited Sigmund Freud, to hold a lecture about Psychology of Sex at the newly renovated University of Moscow."
 bolshevik_russia.66.d:0 "With Zinoviev executed for treason, Kamenev remains as the only possible leader for the Russian Soviet Republic. To celebrate his victory he holds a large speech at the Red Square in Moscow, after which Kamenev started a tour of Moscow, where he visited Lenin’s tomb and stated that he is the “Only man as great as him in the Soviet leadership”, this naturally angered some of the civilians but the ceremony passed beautifully."
 bolshevik_russia.67.d:0 "While the ceremony passed without trouble, not all welcome Kamenev’s rise to power. Particularly the Trade Union’s who want him to weaken the bourgeoisie. This naturally puts them in the sights of Kamenev who keeps an opinion that all bourgeoisie deserve death. Thus this morning Cheka agents were sent to the homes of most of the leaders of those traitorous trade unions..."
 bolshevik_russia.68.d:0 "With the removal of traitors from the union’s gone they remain without leadership, which luckily for Kamenev is a blessing in disguise. Several yesmen have been placed into positions where they rule over the unions. There already has been a massive change in policy and every union is simply repeating whatever Kamenev says..."
 bolshevik_russia.69.d:0 "Vladimir Ivanovich, a simple peasant, rises from bed and walks to his strike. It continues as normal but suddenly three men arrive in a car. One of them is seemingly watching over the other two, as one takes a photo and the other is scribbling something on his notepad. Soon they leave without anyone else noticing them. He continues standing and shouting in the front of the strike, until suddenly hordes of policemen charge them, arresting a great many. As Vladimir gets arrested he can see another man, who he barely knew as “Aleksander” lighting himself on fire as he is dragged away by policemen and cheka agents…"
 bolshevik_russia.70.d:0 "VChK, also known as the cheka, has been mobilized in order to deal with the strikes. Agents are placed on many buildings surrounding the strikes taking pictures and trying to learn the identities of the protestors. Once many leave to retire to sleep they simply arrest them in their homes. This is what is probably the most effective anti-protest tactic yet used. A massive number of agents is being mobilized to deal with them."
 bolshevik_russia.71.d:0 "To further strengthen the brutal dealings of the traitors the Red Guard has been mobilized and sent to deal with the protests. These men rather than jumping on a man resisting them shoot them. This has further weakened the traitorous protestors."
 bolshevik_russia.72.d:0 "As the last protesters are getting arrested, supporters of Kamenev are rejoicing. The protests who started all the while when  Rykov was still leading the Russian Soviet Republic are finally dealt with. All thanks to the valiant effort of the policeman and cheka agent."
 bolshevik_russia.73.d:0 "As supporters of Molotov march alongside him towards the Kremlin, soldiers are sent to stop him. But instead of stopping him they simply salute and join him and his mob. The Council of the People’s Commissars has no choice but to let him in. In there he announces himself as the leader of the Russian Soviet Republics. The following day supporters take other important areas."
 bolshevik_russia.74.d:0 "With them supporting the death of the bourgeoisie, too which Molotov fully agrees with.  However they also support the democratisation of the Russian Soviet Republic, something that is unacceptable. Thus under orders from Comrade Molotov they are supposed to be banned, all their members no longer members and their leadership arrested."
 bolshevik_russia.75.d:0 "With the traitors filling the street, comrade Molotov has sent out orders instructing policemen and the troops to start arresting various people. Nationalists, reformists or other scum are often visited by NKVD-men at two in the morning, when they are given an hour to pack their bags and then sent to various camps, where they are often beaten and forced to work. They get fed nearly nothing and zero resources are sent to keeping them alive."
 bolshevik_russia.76.d:0 "Many landlords, kulaks and similar traitors are often being visited by NKVD agents in the middle of the night, this naturally leaves plenty of land unworked. Thus Molotov in his never-ending wisdom has started a process for giving out that said land to the people. To support such a policy Molotov isn’t taking the land of only the men who have weakened the state but also other men. Even stateland is often given out to farmers."
 bolshevik_russia.77.d:0 "With the traitorous protests going on, we need more loyal men watching the streets. Thus the NKVD has been mobilized and sent to the streets. Often much more brutal than the regular policeman and soldier, they are making sure the protestors regret their decision."
 bolshevik_russia.78.d:0 "With the fact that there are rumors that some soldiers have deserted into the masses of the protestors, Molotov has passed executive order 264, which states that every officer in the Russian Soviet Army must be from the NKVD. This is done for quite obvious reasons. The officers are granted the right to court martial the men and punish them in any way they see fit in order to keep discipline."
 bolshevik_russia.79.d:0 "Soviet NKVD men walk into the home of every protestor, every politician who has decided to stand against Molotov. They are arrested and taken to an agreed upon locations, where they are shot. Who gets arrested is simply decided from massive lists, each consisting of 200 names. The simple protestors are usually simply shot while the politicians are tortured and put on trial, where they receive a just sentence of death."
 bolshevik_russia.80.d:0 "With Zinoviev and Kamenev dealt with, there only remained one man great enough to lead our republic, Tomsky. Thus today he marched into the capital of Russian Soviet Republic with the support of every worker and soldier. The leader of the nation’s biggest trade union began his rule with the promise of dealing with the “Rich Traitorous Bourgeoisie who fights against the Russian people.”"
 bolshevik_russia.81.d:0 "Tomsky himself walked to the protests and, with a microphone, started saying a speech that challenged the protests before stepping down and walking to the workers, to listen to their problems and offer solutions, or simply debate them if he saw the problem not worthy for the state’s attention. He urged them to calm down and simply return home, and to leave the issues to him."
 bolshevik_russia.82.d:0 "With Tomsky himself being a trade unionist, it was fairly easy to organise a meeting with the rest. It began simply, and ended into a massive debate regarding the bourgeoisie, which Tomsky had managed to win. Many pledged unconditional support to him and Tomsky himself promised to grant them some economic power, to grant them comunes to run."
 bolshevik_russia.83.d:0 "Many protesters are simply walking home and finally leaving  the protests. Most are pleased with the fact that Tomsky is actually addressing and dealing with their issues, rather than doing the opposite than what they wanted. While many still remain, they shall soon fickle out and disappear."
 bolshevik_russia.84.d:0 "“The Russian Red Guard has been mobilized by order of Tomsky, so move up men. Remember, you’re mobilized in order to keep Russia free from any more chaos, for it’s people do not deserve it. Russians must live all around the world free from foreign interference or chaos! You are it’s first and last wall!...” - shouts a Soviet red guard commissar to his troops as they armed themselves and go march for yet another boring shift. He is ordered to simply watch over the protestors. Not even allowed to use a gun if anyone attacks him he is supposed to simply talk with him..."
 bolshevik_russia.85.d:0 "With the news of the Red Guard mobilization, Tomsky has ordered that there be new militia’s either armed or formed all around Russia. The government is arming themselves out of its own pockets many Russian civilians are finding a gun in their hands, the only caveat is that they must use it to defend their home towns if any foreign army attacks or anything else the government needs."
 bolshevik_russia.86.d:0 "All remaining spare Policemen are being sent to deal with the protestors. While violence as a whole is not permitted for them, they still can arrest them. Police has always been used to keep watch and deal with the unrest but it is not until now that they send their every man to deal with them..."
 bolshevik_russia.87.d:0 "With the destruction of the protests months ago and the syndicalisation of Russia on the way, comrade Tomsky has decided to move for the Russian people and form syndicalist elections. Each syndicate now democratically elects their leader, who in turn decide important choices for them and organize activities, festivals and generally anything for the Russian people that they might need. While this is not much, this is a massive flood of freedom which the people have not seen yet."
 bolshevik_russia.88.d:0 "With the Triumvirate de facto in power, it was natural that some men fell out. Tomsky tried to discredit Zinoviev and Kamenev but that backfired on him. It only left Zinoviev and Kamenev. But Zinoviev has been victorious with the support of the NKVD. And thus he finally sent them to take the final needed remnants keeping total power from him..."
 bolshevik_russia.89.d:0 "With the chaos going on, this is the first leader of the Russian Soviet Republic who has went down to the streets to actually speak with the people. He simply marched in and started asking them questions, why they were protesting and such. Simply scribbling what they said on a notebook before leaving."
 bolshevik_russia.90.d:0 "With Zinoviev talking with the people there remain the traitors who were supposed to take care of them rather than throw the union into chaos for their own good. Thus today glorious comrade Zinoviev has ordered their arrest and trial. It is reported that some have been outraged."
 bolshevik_russia.91.d:0 "With the news of Zinoviev talking with the people and the arrest of the union leaders who have been organizing this entire mess arrested, the protests have soon died out."
 bolshevik_russia.92.d:0 "While the strike is over the unrest remains. Thus under comrade Zinoviev’s orders the red army has been ordered to mobilize and deal with it. The battalions are already at work with dealing with it!"
 bolshevik_russia.93.d:0 "With the unrest furthering, members of the Communist Youth have been armed and sent to deal with it, after a quick course on shooting of course. While actually they are meant to just stand and look pretty, they have actually intervened and stopped crimes that were going on. Interestingly they are even permitted to take their weapons to school. So teachers can see rows of armed schoolboys march to school..."
 bolshevik_russia.94.d:0 "With the strike gone and the red guard and red youth mobilized. Zinoviev has effectively destroyed the fear in the streets, and even then the red guard and youth both work in coordination to make sure there remains no more chances of bombs going off."
 russian_war.0.d:0 "Vasily Tarasovich, a Soviet soldier, had survived massive clashes on the border with the Russian Democratic Republic. His entire sector had suddenly been attacked by the Russian Democratic Republic and suffered huge loses, Vasily Tarasovich was simply sitting in his trench before they were bombarded by a hail of artillery shells. The hero ran to an MG gun and lit fire towards the enemy. Despite getting hit numerous times he still held and continued fire. It is thought his position would have been taken if it was not him, he bled out after the engagement. Other positions were not as fated as his one… The question remains of revenge."
 russian_war.1.d:0 "The socialist cowards have started an offensive against our brave men, pushing many back from their initial positions and barely holding their sector our men are bloodied, and all thanks to the cowardice of the socialists. We are left with only two solutions, either reinforce the front and contest them or retreat."
 russian_war.2.d:0 "Our glorious socialist forces launched a counterattack which slaughtered them. Now these cowards have fled the sector leaving it for us. Local socialists from the sector are joining our troops as we loot the area."
 russian_war.3.d:0 "With the recent counterattack slaughtering their forces, they dare to try to resist us and launch a counter-attack of their own. Large casualties have been reported and our forces have been pushed out of the sector. But this leaves us one choice; war."
 russian_war.5.d:0 "With our raid against them, they have shown their bravery and retreated from the sector rather than facing us like men. Our men, victorious are looting their lands and dead bodies of  the few that dared to resist."
 russian_war.6.d:0 "The cowardly Russian Democratic Republic are murdering socialists and other men who dare to stand against their tyrannical regime. Our comrades are being mutilated, hanged and shot in their streets. Their just-less trials are sending a many of innocent men to their deaths..."
 russian_war.7.d:0 "A bomb has destroyed a ship in Archangelsk but we all know there can be only one scum low enough to do it; the dirty reactionaries. We must admit, they did their job quite well, leaving no evidence, but alas there is no other possibility, no one else as traitorous as they are."
 russian_war.8.d:0 "The vermin known as the, comrade for give me for uttering this word, the Russian Democratic Republic, have been a nuisance to us ever since the civil war began. They are stopping the final victory of socialism. Comrade, it is our civic duty to destroy them, we must not wait anymore, we must push now and push hard, for socialism depends on it, for the Russian people depend on it..."
 russian_war.9.d:0 "The southern traitors are at war, and thus comrade, we must attack, we must regain the lands we lost in 1927. They lack the forces to defeat both us and their foe. We can finally defeat them and gain land vital in defeating the rest of the Russians. Za Rodinu!"
 russian_war.10.d:0 "The bolsheviks have attacked the Southern Russian Socialist Republic, thus leaving their western front open for our loyal and good armies. We can finally defeat them and we’ll be able to dine in Moscow tomorrow. For whoever controls Moscow shall control Russia… They will not handle a war on two fronts."
 
 #####Russian Democratic Republic
 russian_republic.1.t:0 "Russian Democratic Republic in 1934"
 russian_republic.1.d:0 "The story of Russian Democratic Republic began in 1919, when advancing Red Army units cut off units of the reactionary Northern Army, thus effectively splitting war effort of anti-bolsheviks in Northern Russia in half. The next few years proved to be difficult for the defenders against Bolshevik horde, and only survived thanks to the help provided by Entente, however, thanks to supplies from West, and sheer willpower, reactionaries held. Years slowly passed, and Northern Front seemed to be the quietest in the blood river that was Russian Civil War, as both sides had their eyes on other targets. Military Action resumed in 1922, when the weakened Red forces among Trans-Siberian railway were destroyed in the last big offensive by the Reactionary forces, and units, that were encircled almost three years ago, rejoined with their brothers in arms, however, the reactionary efforts to destroy Red units on the Central Siberia proved to be fruitless, mainly due to the rough terrain, climate and successful defense on the Bolshevik side. In 6.June, 1923, Anti-Bolshevik "Movement", if you could call it that by this point, collapsed completely, as talks between the various leaders only achieved unfortunate anger in the reacionary leadership. In the following months, chaos accross what was formely Russia, ensured. Russian Democratic Republic was proclaimed on a dark and cold night, at Kazan, between 10th and 11th November of 1923. It was build as a presidential republic, with the State Duma acting as a parliament, directly elected by the citizens of the republic, and keeping president of the state in check. The support for the government of the republic is secured by Grigory Afanasyevich Verzhbitsky with his 1st Northern Russian Army, and the new state is founded upon conservative and capitalist ideals. However, reality soon catched optimistic citizens of the Russian Republic unprepared. The new state was unable to liquidate power of the great nobles, military officials, landlords and factory owners, and it soon reflected on to the economy of the nation, as more than fourty percent of the population lives under the poverty line in 1934, with unemployment, occasional limited famines, suicides and general criminalities being common in the lands of Russian Republic. President of republic, Vasily Maklakov, is fulfilling his third term, and is massively unpopular among the people, as the Elections of 1935 arrive. The direct consequence of unpopular government is the low voter turnout, standing at just thirty percent. As such, anti-democratic forces are fairly popular in the instable nation, and the socialist threat outside it's borders still stand strong - stronger than the republic, anyways. The Russian army is failing to corruption, their organization is decaying, and there is a ongoing insurgency in South of the country, made by Mari separatists. What does the future hold for the Russian Republic?"
 russian_republic.1.a:0 "Long Live Russia!"
 russian_republic.2.t:0 "Maklakov Resigns"
 russian_republic.2.d:0 "Vasily Maklakov, the president of the Russian Republic since it's creation in 1923, has officialy resigned, seeing the shared hatred of him among the population, he is supposed to govern and provide for. As such, Republic stands without a new president until the elections of 1935, leaving the country without a strong figure at the top - that is, if Maklakov could ever have been considered strong at all. This move has been widely celebrated by both the Russian Union and "All for Russia!" memebers and leaders alike, who considered Maklakov a traitor to the Russian people. At the same time, seeing the overall instability of the central government, it seems that Mari separatists are ramping up their attacks, with 6 soldiers already reported missing since the announcement of Maklakov's resignation... "
 russian_republic.2.a:0 "Farwell"
 russian_republic.3.t:0 "Economic Disaster"
 russian_republic.3.d:0 "So far, the economy of the republic was barely funcioning, mostly relaying the the thugs employed by factory owners and landlords to keep the workers in check. However, with the advent of the economic crisis in the whole world, the disaster has now reached Russia too. As the imports and exports to the West have stopped, many former factories stand empty, with even the harshest of the harshest murderers not being able to hold workers in the cities, working for few bread slices a day, against their will. This, almost total, collapse of the economy doesn't bring anything good for the Russia and Russian people, with thousands of people out of their jobs, and hundreds of thousands left without a reliable food source. In this atmosphere, many flock to the Russian Union, which has loudly announced that the days of capitalism in the Russia are over, and has even gone as far as providing food suplies to the starving population with the support of rural farmers, who stand for their cause. Similar efforts, although not as successful, have been employed by the "All for Russia" organization, mainly supplying families of war veterans."

The Peasant’s Party, main liberal party, which has been working hand in hand with the conservative government and who lays the main focus onto the modernisation of the Russian rural areas, like education of agriculture, and also large supporters of ties with UK and USA, and Russian Social-Democratic Party, leftovers of the Russian Social Democrats who supported anti-bolshevik forces, and who aim to create a welfare state and reconcile with the revolutionaries in the South, to create a common front against Bolshevik Russia."

 russian_republic.5.d:0 "With the new government being formed, the issue of Russian Union was brought to the attention of Duma, much to the protests of Russian Union representatives present. Born out of ashes of the “National-Revolutionary Movement” in 1931, Russian Union is the largest Russian pelekist-inspired party in the former Russian Empire, rivaled only by Konstantin Vladimirovich Rodzaevsky on the East Coast. While a strong anti-clergy, anti-orthodox and Slavic Pagan force, Russian Union has attracted a big following in the Russian North-East, because of their unapologetic anti-bolshevism, anti-capitalism, pro-worker stance, promotion of Russian culture and identity, and their paramilitary wing, known as “Greenshirts”, who regularly attack social-democratic and liberal foes in the streets. As such, many moderate elements view Russian Union as a timebomb waiting to explode when the time is right, and support systematic destruction of it, while many fear that it would provoke unnecessary violence."

 russian_republic.6.d:0 "Since the beggining of the republic, the republic government proved to be unable to destroy the influence of the old monarchist and reactionary guard. Wealthy land owners, former and present military officials, factory owners - all of them have their say in the matters of government. The land reform, originally shown as one of the main goals of republic, still hasn't been finished, and many Russian peasants still practically live under the rule of their local aristocrat. No smaller threat to Russian democracy is organization called "All for Russia". Led by a former Russian officer Bermont, “All For Russia” is a reactionary organization, mostly made up of military leaders and supported by war veterans. Organization is strictly anti-bolshevik and pro-orthodox, but has fallen behind the Russian Union in the last years. Some of the members have faced backlash for calling for the return of the Tsar, and most seem to hold monarchist sympathies. Since the election, many have proposed that we relieve suspected associates of reactionary circles from their positions in government and military, however, this would be a contraversial move among the higher eschalons of society.

It is a name given to a series of laws and revisions, aimed to finally bring the Russian Republic to the 20th century, and to abolish the long lasted injustices against the common people of Russia. The first part of the act, aims to finalize and implement the land reform, after which, the maximum amount of land that could belong to one person would be limited to 50ha. All the remaining land would be nationalized and redistributed amongst the peasant and war veteran population. Any 19th century style injustices against peasants would be penalised and all traces of serfdom would be completely abolished, highly limiting the power of the Russian nobility. Of course, the move has caused wide-spread dissatifaction among the circles of nobility.  "

Welfare act would open up hundreds of state-paid soup kitchens, and would pay child supports to families in need.

Currently, they're only little bit better than slaves, as the rights of the constitution are only guaranteed to Russian citizens, and most of people belonging to other nations simply can't gain the citizenship of the republic. This act would change that, guaranteeing basic rights for everyone residing inside the borders of Russian Republic, and would allow to achieve the citizenship of Russia far easier, and among other things, would try to integrate the minorities into the Greater Russian nation. This move has recieved harsh critique among the ranks of Russian nationalists and reactionaries, who believe that it would shake the basic foundations of Russian people and the republic.  "

The main force, lead by Anastasy Vonsiatsky himself, marched into the capital of the republic, Kazan, from five different directions, before making their way through the city and finally stopping at the State Duma. In the next few minutes, elite brigade of greenshirts, called "Assault Troops of Vonsiatsky" blasted through the doors, shooting everyone daring to oppose them. After reaching the main hall, every major liberal and social-democratic politican was dragged out of the building and executed just few minutes later on the streets of Kazan, in the front of the crowd. After executions, Vonsiatsky addresed the nation, announcing the creation of a "truly Russian state" and proclaimed "the degenerated republic" dead. A new dawn for the Russian State has risen. "

In a swift action, all politicians of liberal and social democratic parties were rounded up, and although there are some reports of missing persons coming back from the rural countryside, where AfR units acted relatively unchecked, most of them were imprisioned, rather than executed. After all major areas were under control, Pavel Bermont drove into the city, both greeted and looked at in fear, and formally disbanded State Duma, proclaiming himself as the acting leader of Russian Republic. As the new regime is supported by the army and war veterans, any unrest or action against it seems hopeless. So far, it's unclear wheter Bermont, himself a rumored monarchist, aims to recreate Russian Empire, or stay in power himself, effectively making Russian Republic into a reactionary, anti-bolshevik and military dictatorship.

"All for Russia" has massive support among army, so it would be possible to use their support base to finally bring stability to this God-forsaken country.

Many former generals and politicians are calling for support against the new regime, even attracting many army units.

At first the war was a stalemate, however with the encirclement of the first army led by general August Keim, led to a rapid deterioration and a disastrous retreat east. The more fanatical of Keim's first army deserted and became partisans, however the majority capitulated. Lundendorf's forces managed to defend Berlin long enough for the navy, which remained loyal to the Kaiser, to evacuate the civilians and notable number of soldiers and divisions into east Prussia, despite their undeniable defeat in mainland Germany, the kaiser and naturally conservative Prussians stand firm in their bid to keep on the so called "Sitzkrieg". With their defeat in the mainland, Kaiser Wilhelm II had been forced into abdication, and the throne naturally went to his son, Wilhelm III. Ignoring the official state of war, the main issue plaguing Prussia is the non-Germanic minorities, such as the Poles, Lithuanians and Kursenieki, demanding more and more rights from a weakened Germany, and germanization efforts have been completely grounded to a halt. Furthermore a rising popularity of Pelekism and German ultra-nationalism is worsening the situation even more, with daily street fights ruining the otherwise beautiful east Prussian towns.

Meanwhile the Kaiser and his father were lying in a puddle of blood. Moments later ambulances arrived and rushed them to the hospital.\nHis father, Wilhelm IIth, died a few minutes after the initial injury, however Wilhelm IIIrd put up a fight against his wounds.

The town, already known as a stronghold of Prussian pelekists among a sea of Lithuanian villages, soon rallied and met the Lithuanian protest with a mob of its own. While the local police tried its best, they still failed to keep the peace, and soon the crowds clashed, as some men had somehow acquired weapons beforehands. Out of the initial fight there were 31 declared dead and many more wounded during this bloody massacre, as the gunfire had been unanimously from the German side, the mass majority of the casualties were ethnic Lithuanians. Only 9 of those 31 were Germans, as the Lithuanian mob instead of panicking charged the Germans. The only thing that managed to break the brawl had been a small group of Poles, who had incidentally came visiting from a few towns further south, and in their infinite wisdom decided it would be best to attack both sides. This had the side result of uniting them temporarily, after the Poles were dealt with both sides parted ways. Both sides of the struggle seem to view this as a black day, and now there are whispers about a union of both sides and to change their focus on what they deem larger issues against Pelekism..."

He was getting more and more immersed and disconnected from the outside world, the longer he read his own writtings. \n\nIt was already morning, when he finally put down the papers, which had bothered him all night. He woke up few hours later, feeling unsatissfied with his sleep, and decided to go out for a walk. Upon returining, all doubts had left his head, and vision for Germanic State was clearer than ever before."
 prussia.26.d:0 "It was a slow midday in the Prussian State, only getting interupted by a occasional car passing by. At the same time, the Prussian Pelekist Council was full with life - every last one of Rosenberg's comrades was summoned in capital, to discuss important matters of state \n\n"My fellow warriors!",Rosenberg exclaimed,"The time has come to finally bring back that, which was stolen from us! Today, right here, I propose the creation of entirely new Aryan aristocracy!" The audience was buzzing like a massive bee swarm, only calmed by Rosenberg himself. "As such, all old titles of the degredated Prussian reactionaries will be abolished, giving a way for a new form of goverment. A one by Aryans, for Aryans!"\n\nThe proposal was passed with 120-0, with everyone being in full support of Rosenberg's idea. In practice, this will mean a Neo-Feudal system, led by local nobles, who will be picked out of the Prussian Pelekist Council, and who will have to adhere to mythical, thousands of years old rites, found in works such as Rigaveda and Bhagavad Gita."
 prussia.27.d:0 "It was a dark, and cool night, as suddenly, a fire was lit, enlightening the black Prussian woods.Drums stared beating, and a group of 27 Lithuanians stood in a circle, with the fire, full of fire and energy, burning in the middle. They were all dressed in white robes, with only one of them having a red belt, decorated with Baltic symbols. It was Vydūnas. He stepped closer to fire, carrying a bowl with milk, honey, and rye bread. He slowly put it all in the fire, as other continued their ancient song. The fire sparkled, and the food slowly burned. Vydūnas looked up, right into midnight sky. \n\nEveryone was waiting for him to get ready, and start his speech. After a brief period, Vydūnas opened his mouth."Thousands of years ago, we were stripped from our spirituality, our rulling class was destroyed, and we were left wandering in the dark. No more, I tell you, as the Aryan has finnaly found his way to light again. For no longer will we be led by disgusting forms of government, created by human falsehoods - the power will return to the hands of Aryan Heroes and Philosophers!"\n\n Pelekist Council was promptly disbanded, and a Council of Brammans, refering to the name of old Baltic Priests, was put in it's place. Dovas Zaunius alongside 25 other members of Lithuanian-Prussian origin, now make up the main governing body of Rytprūsija."

Just because the French tri-color flew heroically over their captured German lands, the victory itself was much more hollow than it appeared to their western counterparts.\n\n Since the end of the conflicts, the French administration has seen a growing number of political radicalization. Both far left and far right groups have grown popularity en mass and it has begun to threaten both the people of France as well as the ideals of democracy which have been held so dear since the French Revolution. Some of these groups claim to be the champion of the workers and wish to revive the ideas of the Paris Commune from years before. Others wish to realize French identity and wish to see a rise of a new French empire. Either way, both of these radical political ideologies wish to dismantle the existing French democratic system. \n\nWith one of their greatest rivals, Germany, divided and humiliated France appeared to have the upper hand as far as a dominant power in mainland Europe.

These men, identifiable by their golden polo shirts, have formed cells all around the nation expanding rapidly though the influence of young impressionable men. What frightens those in opposition to the pelekists is that many former military officers have joined them in organizing these cells. Using their membership to claim that they care more for the armed forces than the government. Tensions begin to pile as the ideas of the party begin to spread within the military's ranks, quickly becoming popular with your average soldier. The party takes this as a sign to begin a revolution, Maurras orders that the members of the party, along with the Gold Shirts, march to Paris to save the government from socialism and communism. As they marched, the pelekists would meet and violently attack those that stood in their way, gaining the attention of the government.\n\nThe army would be called forth to deal with the pelekists but the men sent in would hesitate to do anything against them. A cold standoff would ensue where both sides would just stand idly by, neither force would make the first move.

Police were deployed, but they were forbidden from provoking the crowd. Unfortunately, the mere presence of law enforcement was not enough to pacify the masses. Riots and looting have erupted in multiple cities. Business owners would react to these events by hiring hoodlums and Right-Wing paramilitaries to defend their property via force, to disperse the thuggish rioters.

In the aftermath official reports of the explosion would find that it claimed the lives of 20 men and wound several others.\n\nWith the police busy combating radicals on the streets there would be no investigation conducted on those responsible for the attack. Fearing for their lives, many politicians would begin to flee Paris in droves. Most conservatives would abandon the capitol by the months end and a good portion of liberals have left, yet there would be a few that would stay behind to continue leading from Paris.

Hubs of socialist and pelekist activity would find themselves raided by the military. And the military itself would begin to arrest those that showed any sympathies for either side. The use of military force would only escalate the amount of violence on the streets, as the socialist partisans and Gold Shirts would begin to defend themselves with their own stockpiles of weapons.\n\nThe violence against their own people would lead many members of the military disgruntled with the state of France to look inwards as to who is truly responsible. Officers such as François de La Rocque, Louis Franchet d'Espèrey, Charles de Gaulle, and François Darlan would be opposed to the government and their actions.

This would not come however, as the red tide swallowed the German state and French efforts only gaining the Rhineland from the grips of the reds. The resource rich province of the former German Empire brought about its own problems and was not economically powerful enough to save the faltering economy, bringing the nation to ruin. Now that the country has healed since that time the question of whether or not to open the economy up again ensued. Economists and capitalists call for the country to open, opposed by a small lobby of protectionists that fear another collapse. The world, however unstable it may be, has began to recover from the Great Depression in their own ways. Giving credence to those who want a more open market. The government chooses to side with the economists, but only a few stocks are opened to foreigners as a testbed for the possibility of opening the other markets."

However, put through the flames of combat the monarchists thrived better than before, their cause more united against the pelekists, socialists, and republicans of France to achieve victory over them.\n\nToday a new form of National Integralism stands at the forefront of politics. One that revives true monarchism, radical catholicism, and 20th century nationalism. A new age of absolutism driven by a catholic monarch leading the French people.

The most ambitious project yet, being greater than the rebuilt Notre-Dame, what would become the centerpiece for the French Pelekists.\n\nThe new structure is heralded to be the largest man-made structure in Europe. A stone podium 315 x 315 m (1,033 x 1,033 ft) and 75 m (250 ft) high would have served as the base of the building. A granite dome measuring 290 m (950 ft) high, with a diameter of more than 250 m (820 ft) would be placed over the podium. The finishing piece being a statue to Taranis measuring 46 m (150 ft) in diameter standing proud over the new monument to Dumezil's France.

While having many clergymen in their ranks the rest of the French Catholic Church would stay relatively neutral in the political scene. Members of the Pelekist party would then begin enacting plans to infiltrate the church, first through their own members disseminating their ideas, then by looking into corrupt members and luring them through favors, finishing off their plans by having those loyal to the party begin to shun those who stand against the pelekists.\n\nWith the church mostly under the control of the Pelekist Party, Dumezil would continue his vision of reconstruction. One building destroyed before the civil war that still lays in ruin, Notre-Dame, would be viewed as the first to detail this new architectural style he'd want the country to head towards. Through his contacts in the church and many of the priests in the party advocating for a friend of his to rebuild Notre-Dame. The building would have somewhere between a mixture of neo-classical and pagan style architecture with a hint of brutalism, being labeled as neo-gallic by the state press during the construction process.

 spartakus_germany.1.d:0 "The Burgerkrieg of 1920, following the surrender of the German Empire in the Great War is still a bitter memory for many Germans. The battle of Bremen, while successful was long and bloody, and the various partisan groups flooded the nation. Luxembourg knew that drastic times call for drastic measures, which lead to multiple atrocities within the following years.\n\n Famine, industrialization and the incident in Kiel where troops fired on unarmed civilians are just the highlights of what the young German state has seen. It may not be perfect, but it isn’t a cesspool of ethnic conflict and hierarchical corruption like that of those Loyalist pigs in Prussia. \n\n1934 is the dawn of a new era for Germany. One that could solidify Germany as either a blazing fire that liberates the workers of the world or just a spark that fizzles our quick. The only question remains… How will this fire burn? "

Today, the Spartakusbund Council will choose where to concentrate first. \n\nThe north has been plagued by the roots of weeds within their soil. And the perpetrators of planting said weeds is no more than the Prussian menace to the east. These foul and pure excuses of human life are disgusting stains on our great nation. The Northern Partisans, according to our inteligence, are supported by monarchists in East Prussia, and are ideological reactionaries. \n\nThe south is still littered with various forces that threaten our regime. These so called “liberators of the German people” are nothing more but bands of terrorists and monsters. They ravage the country side, killing factory heads and police, destroying public property and threaten the socialist way of life. They are no worse then the traitors of the east. The Southern partisans are supported by their Austrian, Italian and Croatian comrades, and appear to follow a strange ideology called "Pelekism"."

 spartakus_germany.8.t:0 "The First Part: Economy"
 spartakus_germany.8.d:0 "The first and most important part in this year's congress is given to economic disscusions. \n\nThe economy of Spartacist Germany is an weird one. While DIG, or German Industrial Society is the main planning organ of the nation, responsible for nation-wide economic plans, the implemention of the plans are left to local representatives of Spartakusbund. Meanwhile, in recent years, more anarchist-aligned communes have sprung up in urban districts and rural villages alike, which are effectively out of the reach by central government. This has led to unstable economic structure, which is no way prepared to face modern challenges.\n\nThe first faction within the Spartakusbund, grouped together as "National Bolsheviks" propose to get rid of anarchist-aligned communes, heavily invest in agriculture and focus on centralizing such economic matters as armament production and resource excavation. \n\nSecond faction within Spartaksubund are the supporters of status-quo. In their view, the current economic policy is on the right path towards achieving full socialism. They want to keep the delicate balance between central state organs and local socialist initiative. \n\nThe third largest faction within the Spartakusbund is a coallition of various Libertarian socialists, such as fringe German Anarchist or Syndicalist groups, and people advocating for more liberal approach in general. They want to see German economy focusing solely on workers, in a democratic manner.\n\nThe voting starts. "

 spartakus_germany.9.d:0 "The second part of the German Congress is directed at the question of the armed forces. \n\nThe armed forces of Socialist Germany, just like it's economy, is an mix between rather decentralized structures and highly organised ones. Former war veterans and revolutionaries make up the bulk of NVA, providing it with the much required manpower and basic infantry. This part of military is often poorly equipped and trained. At the same time, there are multiple Rotkorp divisions under our command, which were the most elite troops during Great and Civil war. These Rotkorps have access to modern technologies, and are build with fast warfare in mind. \n\nThe National Bolshevik faction has been a strong advocate for larger centralization and expansion of the NVA, to bring the whole army up to a modern level, aiming to modernize NVA and reform it into a force capable of facing French or Italian armies in battlefields.\n\nMeanwhile, the Luxembourgist faction has opposed such expansion for a long time, rather aiming to build up a modern and technically advanced core, basing it off Rotkorps, seeing armored warfare as the next step for fighting doctrine. \n\nFinally, the Democrats, who haven't been really keen on massive military campaings across all of Europe, have put forwards a plan, which would shift the backbone of our army onto the hands of local defense forces, only keeping a small and agile force under direct government control.\n\nVotes are being casted."

Teachers, intellectuals, writters and journalists have been critical of our socialist system from the start, and regurally use their positions to undermine our policies.\n\nMost radical of the factions, National Bolsheviks, advocate for a total destruction of any harmful thought or intent found within our society. Not only pelekist and reactionary partisans in North and South would face death penality, but various thinkers imprisioned for anti-socialist positions too. We don't give allow our enemies to have guns, why allow them to have ideas? \n\nLuxembourgist faction has exclaimed for a long time, that this is only a transition phase, which will go away as time goes by. As such, they only want to see the current policies continued and larger warfare against partisan traitors. \n\nDemocrats have come out with a rather weird proposal. They propose reforming most of our enemies inside full time re-education camps, and only shooting them if they don't fit in even after exceptional pressure. They also support amnest for people with reactionary past, and long-imprisioned partisans and our opponents.\n\n Votes are being counted."

While currently there are large socialist movements in both France, United Kingdom and Italy, we cannot just wait for revolution to come magically. We are very isolated internationally, with only Wallonia standing by our side, after their socialist party achieved victory in the most recent elections. As such, we should make our position clear. \n\nNational Bolsheviks support the most limited form of expansion, only really wanting to unite former German lands, in which Germans make up the majority, avenging wrongs that were pressed upon us after the last war, and making Germany the continental power of mainland Europe. \n\nLuxembourgists, on the other hand, being international oriented, only see Germany as a vehicle, using which revolution can be brought to the whole world. Their imminent goals include desctruction of reactionary regimes around us, and destruction of French hegemony. \n\nDemocratic Socialists, while not being far behind Luxembourgists, are rather careful regarding military expansion, and would rather see other socialist movements achieving victory, with our covert support. \n\nPeople are voting.

The position of Chairman.\n\nPolitical structure of Germany is based upon Spartakusbund, or Spartacist League, which is the only legal party in our controlled lands. Every district of our lands has their own representative, which is elected by local populace for 4 years, totaling at around 1000 people from whole of Germany, Once every seven years, every socialist local representative meets in Berlin, in All-German Congress such as this one, to vote on the most important questions of the socialist state, and on the people making up the Spartacist Council, which in a sense works similar to ministers in liberal democracies. Afterwards, all members of Council vote on a new Chairman, Chairman being the main leader at the top, with various powers, such as vetoing various projects of Council.\n\nNational Bolsheviks in the Congress have proposed expanding powers of the Chairman, to allow for a stronger, more centralized leadership, capable of dealing with various issues, which could arise any moment, especially in such circumstances as we find ourselves in. \n\nLuxembourgists, being the Status-Quo aren't keen on radical changes, and want to see continuation of current policies. \n\nDemocratic Socialist faction sees the Chairman position as a one-way ticket to dictatorship, and want to see powers of Chairman limited even more, if not abolished entirely. \n\nClock is ticking."

They detail important information regarding partisans and also information about the individual partisans, including their names. Soldiers have been ordered to visit their families and, depending on their mood, chose an execution. \n\nEntire families were slaughtered in ways ranging from a simple firing squad to them being tied to a tree with their own guts until they starved or bled out."

At first the animalism of the bandits had been working and managed to deal large loses, but then Panzer reinforcements arrived, which the partisans couldn’t effectively combat and thus were quickly routed. Among the dead bodies commander of local cell was found. The partisan situation has led to a zero-tolerance policy regarding supporters of the traitorous cause.

Pelekism is also a fairly popular ideology, but nowhere close enough to win an election. The biggest Pelekist party is the Lietuvos Nacionalistų Partija(LIthuanian Nationalist Party) led by Augustinas Voldemaras, which often works with the reactionary Lietuvos Tautininkų Partija led by the first president, Antanas Smetona. The Perkūnininkai, another Pelekist group led by Beržanskis is also noteworthy. The only thing that may be considered “unstable” in the small nation is the militaries love of joining into politics, but so far no one wories about that. \n\nEthnically it is also stable, however the reactionary Samogitian minority in western Lithuania often complains about so-called repression.

During the talks, which lasted for around three hours and covered topics ranging from the state of Lithuania to the history of socialism, both agreed on nearly all issues, and thus suddenly a major socialist offered Kazys Grinius an offer too sweet to not accept. Simply put, he wanted Grinius to accept him and others into the Lithuanian government for guaranteed support for all policies. Grinius delighted accepted and celebrated with some champagne."

 lithuania.10.d:0 "Today, at 8:20, Kazys Grinius had been shot by the nationalist Voldemaras during his daily commute to the presidential palace by bus. Grinius was well known for his hatred of large spending for his own needs, thus he had refused to invest in a car, instead preferring to use the bus in which he can speak with everyday people. This had been under heavy scrutiny by the Saugumas, who had feared such an event would happen.\n\nThe assasination itself had happened once Voldemaras had stepped onto the train and started approaching Grinius, who according to other commuters had been looking at him with a surprised face. Grinius is said to have stated “I thought you were dead!” before Voldemaras pulled a gun and shot 3 bullets into his corpse sending the bus into a panicked frenzy. Somehow no civilian was hurt by Voldemaras before he got swarmed by socialist goons who beat him while waiting for the police and paramedics. One of the goons had picked up the gun of Voldemaras and shot him. According to a statement from a civilian named Mykolas Petrauskas Voldemaras’s last words had been “Such cowardice can be expected by communists, to shoot a man who merely killed a rat and avoided spilling the blood of his own people!”. He was shot in the face and body was beaten up too hard to be recognized by the family of Voldemaras, the goons had also been arrested.\n\nBy the time paramedics arrived Grinius had somehow remained survive, but unconscious. He was rushed to the Vilnius hospital where he was heavily operated, he…"

The most legitimate choice would be his children, but they aren’t popular among the Perkūnininkai, nor are they interested in politics and even renounced any chances of getting the damn throne! \n\nHowever, there still remains a choice that has a small amount of legitimacy and would be supported by other Perkūnininkai members. That being of Visuomis, a man although not a relative of Beržanskis, claims the descent of the same man and acted as a right hand man to Beržankis, which had led to the party being called for a vote, which unsurprisingly ended in his favor. The coronation is set to start soon this year."

He soon died from his old age and was succeeded by Domas Šidlauskas-Visuomis, his right hand man after his children refused the throne. One of the first actions Visuomis completes is quite simple, he organizes a massive parade of men and marches across Lithuanian streets to the ave of civilians, only to stop at the grave of Beržanskis, now remembered with a small monument next to it.\n\nVisuomis simply bows and pays his respect, before turning to his men and starting a grandiose speech. “He was, he still is and he still will be with Lithuania no matter what!” is one of the many things Visuomis shouted in a speech in honour of the former leader. After the speech, in which he declared Beržanskis a hero only comparable to those like Kęstutis or Vytautas, marched into the presidential palace to declare him a national hero, and the day he died on, a day of mourning and celebration.""

Then, on top of the castle, I saw the leader, Visuomis, holding a massive speech. It was quite hard to hear thanks to the massive crowd, all happy but from what I could gather and hear he was ranting about Jews hurting the common people, then I heard him shout “My dear Lithuanian people! The clique of the international jew and his communist supporters have long since tried to destroy the European peoples, ever since Charles the Great, who focused on fighting his German brethren over the Arab in Spain, Jews have owned the banks, Jews have scammed the common people! This ends now! Soon a bill shall be passed by me declaring all usury illegal, and any debt owned by the people - forfeit!”, this naturally led to even stronger cheering from the crowds and even I couldn’t resist<...>”\n\n This is simply the story of one Lithuanian among the many in the crowd. As you can easily gather from this Visuomis has banned usury and all debt has been cancelled, while this will undeniably hurt the Lithuanian economy it will lead in bigger support for Visuomis. After the short speech Visuomis went to the Seimas, who still had kept a major administrational role, and attempted to get his bill passed. Naturally the politicians in the Seimas voted it down, for the same reasons mentioned earlier. But not even slightly disenboldened Visuomis simply used his powers to pass it even without support from the old men sitting in the seimas.<..>"
 lithuania.18.d:0 "Excerpt from Vytis,[GetDateText], No. 65\n\n...At around 2:00 in the night, sounds from the outside could suddenly be heard, including one gunshot. The reason? Well Visuomis has given out an executive order meant to “Fight with Anti-Lithuanian Activities”. Armed men marched into churches and arrested many priests. One, named as Kazys Radvila, attempted to flee but was shot down. He is the only casualty of the raid. In the morning many people were outraged, as when they were going to church they simply found a few soldiers telling everyone to move along and that now the church is “state property”.\n\nIn other news, christian theology classes have been simply replaced with pagan theology classes, which not only focus on the Baltic religion but also on other European pagan faiths such as hellenism and Religio Romana. Books such as Emperor Julian’s “Against the Galilean” are being translated into Lithuanian and the anti christian books that are already translated have been put as necessary reading in order to pass school.<...>"

Many expected it to be worse but in actuality Belarusian rights have probably increased, but the new bill, dedicated to the revival of Belarusian balts, changes it all.\n\nSo it may be easier to explain the changes we interviewed a local belarusian farmer in the village of Pornuškės, named Žyhimont. “Nothing really change instantly after the bill was passed, but we knew changes will come. A week later they(soldiers) came down and took down the signs and destroyed the church, instead replacing it with some Belarusian from Vilnius who claims to worship the “old gods”, whatever that means. We are told to look for spiritual guidance. They(the soldiers) didn't live and in actuality, increased their presence by inviting the party militia. Let’s just say they weren’t as polite as the soldiers… The signs were changed into something in the catholic alphabet and we have been told to learn it.

He replaced them with some new ones, it was a decently sized red textbook with the vytis on top of it. Since I excelled at history and the topic discussed was fairly boring(The Kosciuszko uprising) I decided to check around the book what it had to say.\n\nThe stuff the book spoke about is weird and I haven’t seen it be mentioned by any books, with claims such as that the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth collapsed only due to the Poles, that we never lost a fight in the northern crusade, and the weirdest claim of them all, that Vytautas had a son that moved into Smetona’s home village to form the Smetona family… Then I listened to what the teacher was saying. She was talking about how the uprising was only won by us thanks only to Lithuania, and that all the other factions were defeated. I know this is a straight up lie, since literally every book before this talked about how it was won only due to the sacrifices of all sides…"
 lithuania.25.d:0 "The Lithuanian author named Kazys Binkis describing an alternate reality were Latvian and Estonian rebels defeat the United Baltic Duchy. It describes tensions rising between the new Latvian and Lithuanian republics over the Šventoji region, leading to war between the two nations due to a border skirmish incident which was caused by an unknown side. Rumors hint it was actually the Prussians who instigated the incident. The book depicts the bloody reality of war as the Lithuanians launch an offensive that quickly gets bogged down near Kuldiga.\n\nThere are two main protagonists, Gintaras Ambrazevičius and the Latvian Gatis Purviņš. Gintaras soon loses his brother, named Tadas, in the battle of Saldus and is bitter over the fighting. He nearly kills Gatis in the battle of Kuldiga, but as soon as that is about to happen suddenly a ceasefire is declared, fate has saved Gatis.\n\nThe ceasefire is declared after an unexpected Russian attack forces both sides to unite under a common cause in the hope of not falling together. The book soon ends with the battle of Daugavpils in which Gatis and Gintaras both fight shoulder to shoulder against the Russian hordes where only due to their dedication to their fatherland they win the battle.\n\nThe book is a massive success in both Lithuania and the UBD, with a Latvian version already having been made. It is praised for its unique tale, colourful descriptions and just for simply being well written. The only criticism is raised by people who do not believe such a scenario is even possible. But Binkis himself has said that this is simply creative fiction to tell a great story, thus that should not even matter."

Crowds watched as rows of tightly clad men marched towards the presidential palace, where they listen to a speech by the president, after which the honour guard released 7 shots into the air. After the small ceremony the soldiers marched forwards reach the tower of Gediminas, a symbol of Lithuanian freedom.\n\nMost of the men, and the president, watched as four Lithuanian soldiers climbed up the tower and were supposed to lit a ceremonial bonfire. But one of them seems to be saying something and checking his jacket rather than lighting the fire... Soon another soldier jumped for the torch but it caused the other soldier to drop it. Effectively ruining the ceremony, but nonetheless it had continued after another man relit the torch and put it in the bonfire.\n\nAfter the incident the two main culprits were detained, albeit it was explained there will be no punishment assigned to the both of them. The two offending men were Mantvydas Krauleidys, a man from a military family descending from Kaunas and Ramūnas Kazlauskas, descending from a small village near VIlnius. Both of the men have spotless records, with the only comment being on Mantvydas for his lack of patience.\n\nWhen asked about it he said; “When lighting a fire you must always say “Gabija keep it safe” and throw a piece of food into it, but the thing is, I couldn’t find the piece of bread in my jacket:” - said Kazlauskas, this is confirmed by Krauleidys, who said this when asked “(He) was looking for something in his jacket, it was piss cold up here and I wanted to get down, so my patience eventually ran out, so I did the best thing possible and take the torch from the little lads hands. It didn’t end too well, as you can guess.”"
 lithuania.27.d:0 "With Latvia being annexed into the UBD, a question remains on its people. There are a great many Latvians in the UBD, in Latvia proper, but many forget the fact Lithuania also has its own Latvian minorities. One mustn't forget about the Latvians in the Šventoji region, or the other natives, who often speak their own unique dialect, but by far the most interesting are the political refugees:\n\nThey are almost completely nationalists, many seeing Lithuania as a safe place where they can plot the revival of a Latvian state, and indeed they are met with much support, from both the government and people. Lithuania is extremely helpful to Latvian partisans, perhaps the reason why they are so strong, as every time the Germans do anti-partisan operations they simply cross the border and are fed and armed by the Lithuanian military who sees the war as a massive gain for itself. But nationalists seeking freedom aren’t the only Latvians going to Lithuania. Many simple go there for a better life, where they can speak Latvian to their children and worry not about germanization."

Despite being a small town compared to others such as Telšiai or Raseiniai, it still had a great number of protestors. According to the police, there had been too many people for them to contain, so they had requested the aid of socialist paramilitaries and soldiers to contain them… This happened to be a great mistake. The civilians had been enraged by the presence of men who they had viewed as ruining their land and thus items such as rocks and bottles had been thrown towards them. This naturally caused the men to be stressed and angered which didn’t mean well when a glass bottle hit the face of their commander and broke… He ordered the men to open fire on the civilians.\n\nThe paramilitary couldn’t kill that many of them as they only had rifles however the panic that ensued killed many… The military who had been doing things properly had heard gunshots and started to order the civilians to get behind them and had actually protected them, after a small perimeter had been formed they started to approach the socialist paramilitary.\n\nThe commander of the units, who had been known for taking part in nationalist military Romuva meetings, instantly recognized it was the socialists at fault for this, so he couldn’t pass the opportunity to kill murderers AND political enemies. Thus he ordered his men to open fire. It is safe to say that the paramilitary, who had only been armed only with rifles, didn’t hold well against the soldiers with machine guns. The police in the meantime tried to unsuccessfully deal with the situation peacefully. In total 103 civilians had been killed by the gunfire and panicked frenzy and 34 paramilitary members had been killed by the soldiers who had been hailed as heroes by the crowd. The police in fact tried to arrest the soldiers as they literally opened fire as well, albeit to defend civilians but were easily pushed back by the crowd."

After that the public was shown the riches the state had gained from its interventions, which had amassed to quite the amount. After that he was led to the palace of the grand dukes, nearly destroyed by now and held an oath of soldiers and generals, all swearing loyalty to the new king, to defend him and their Lithuania by the name of Dundulis, a folk name for the Baltic god of thunder Perkūnas used by those deemed not worthy of the real name, and Jesus.\n\nAfter the elaborate ceremony, Visuomis held a speech, lasting for 3 hours, and he had ended it by taking an old sword, which he had claimed was the sword of Kęstutis, the last ruler of Lithuania to die a pagan, and swore an oath, to Perkūnas, that he shall lead Lithuania loyally under the example of his ancestors."

 ###Legions Events
 legion.0.t:0 "The Legion State"
 legion.0.d:0 " Born in the Great War, the Legion consists of Volunteers and POW, mainly Czech. After the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and the start of the Russian Civil War, Tomáš Masaryk, the chairman of the Czechoslovak National Council at the time, arrived in Russia in November 1917 in order to begin plans for the Czechs to evacuate from Russia and return home to fight the Germans. The problem was that all of Russia’s western ports were blockaded. The solution? Travel across the entirety of Siberia to Vladivostok and then take ships to Europe from there. February 1918, The Reds allowed the Czechs to depart towards the east, being briefly interrupted by the German Operation Faustschlag in Ukraine, demolishing the Germans at the Battle of Bakhmach. After leaving Ukraine and entering Soviet Russia, the National Council signed the Penza Agreement with the Reds - forcing the Czechs to hand over most of their guns in exchange for passage. Meanwhile, the Czechs were becoming wary of growing communist sentiment among their ranks. The Czechs arrived in Chelyabinsk by May, and were strung out across the Trans-Siberian Railway.\n\nThe evacuation of the Czechs was slower than anticipated due to a shortage of locomotives, poor conditions of the railway and constant negotiation with the Soviets along the railway. On the 14th of May however, tensions with the Soviets peaked when the chief of the Bolshevik Red Guard, Tukhachevsky, demanded the full disarmament and arrest of the Legionnaires. At an army congress a few days later, the Legion refused to bow down, sparking the Revolt of the Legion. A force of about 70,000 Bolsheviks was crushed as fighting ensued along the railway line, however, the Czechs could no longer advance along the east, as White forces started to close in along the line taking advantage of Soviet weakness. Suddenly met with a fierce offensive from the north-east of Chelyabinsk, the Czechs were forced to dig in along various parts of the railway, resulting in the Battle of Chelyabinsk, which led to a stalemate as the Whites failed to push through the entrenched Czechs, all the while fighting against the Soviets at the same time. Followed by rigorous bombing, the railway occupied by the Czechs was caught in the cross-fire and saw heavy damage. The Czechs could no longer evacuate.\n\nThe Legion is in no way better off than others, existing on the brink of famine. Its industry is primarily locked in Chelyabinsk, and on it’s own is in a terrible state. While reliable, the army is disorganised and underequiped, a result from many purges and lack of resources. Despite the growing discontent and demoralization, Gadja is dreaming big, invisoning a great Pan-Slavic state for all Slavs."

It is likely that any radical change in policy might lead to a mutiniy.\n\nIgnoring the grumbling subordinates, Gadja is convinced, the choice must be made now. Will He follow millenia of Christian tradition in Russia? Perhaps it would be wiser to return to the roots, following the faith of our long gone ancestors?

At one point Collonel accused Gadja of completely halting Legion’s endeavors to come back home in favour of pan-slavic fantasies. Furious, Gadja left the meeting. As he was about to leave the building, a familliar officer stopped him. He said that not all Legionaires felt like Collonel and that they were ready to serve him in the future aswell. The Officer also gave Gadja a bottle of Moravian wine, a great luxury in these parts, as a token of gratitude.\n\n As Gadja returns home, he begins to ponder hes next moves. Make an example Collonel Wojciechowski? Another dead body? Exhausted, he opens the bottle of wine that was previously given to him. How long has it been since he tasted something from home? He wonders as he pours the red liquid in to a cup. Raising it, he toasts the bright moon. Its strong yet bitter, not quite what he expected. No matter, he drinks the remaining vine as he fantasies about greatness of the coming state, about the justice it will enforce on its subjects and the might it will radiate.

Perhaps they perished from starvation, maybe they were eaten, but their numbers are ridiculously small. When it comes to choosing where to import from, we are left with only one option, the nomad nations south of us. Knowing that, our choices of horse breeds are limited.

These objects are poorly garrisoned, so if we could just get one of them for our engineers, it should be possible to reverse engineer blueprints for them. The main problem would be transporting them back to our controlled territory. Luckly, even that has been taken care of.

Strategically speaking, the Legion has finally gained hold of one of the major intersections of the Trans-Siberian railway. The Old members of the Legion are hopeful now, thinking that they are finally one step closer to getting back to Europe. Many of them are betting on the Romanovs allowing access through their lands by making a deal with them. Some even dared to vocalize this notion in presence of the Russian officers, causing heated word exchanges that left both parties displeased.\n\nGadja however, is not of the same opinion. He has no fantasies of an idealized "home", where only joy and peace await him. He knows better than that. This railway point is a start of something entirely different. Standing on Omsks stations fourth perons farthest edge, he looks out into the distance towards north west, where only tracks and occasional houses obstruct his view of the vast wasteland. After a while, he narrows his eyes and glaces eastwards. A small grin gradually forms on Gadjas face.

But to the surprise of Karel, the officers shot him dead as soon as they met him. Infighting broke out through the camp, eventually the rebels being pushed back.\n\nWhile still capable of fighting, the Karelists are certainly shaken by the loss of their leader. With this, the victory is at close."

Sure, the way we look at the world is different, but our goals are the same. Considering this, there might be a possibility to convince yesterday's enemy to become today's comrade.\n\nIn the end, Gadja decides..."
 legion.30.t:0 "Regarding Food Rations…"
 legion.30.d:0 "Situated between Europe and Asia and blessed with rich mineral deposits, the trade hub city of Chelyabinsk grew to be one of the most industrialized cities in Siberia. So it should come as no surprise, that it was quick to hear about the Tsar's demise. At first, these news caused joy to the underpaid and overworked workers, which hastily went out on the streets and clashed with authorities, demanding the immediate establishment of a workers council.To the governors surprise, many of his own men joined the rebels, refusing to open fire on their countrymen. The hostilities lasted for two days and only stopped, when the Chelyabinsk Peoples Council was proclaimed.\n\nThe workers, unsurprisingly, made a few mistakes afterwards. Unfortunately, those proved to be crucial. The collectivisation of industrial assets and the redistribution of wealth, which was seized from big time merchants and magnates, might have worked if a civil war had not broken out. Due to the decrease in production efficiency and the decimation of trade, the city's economy plummeted.\n\nAfter almost a year, a train convoy, which was carrying soldiers, arrived at the central terminal. Soon after a conflict erupted between socialist militias and the new arrivals. The situation escalated to the point where Tukhachevsky, chief of the Bolshevik Red Guard, ordered their immediate arrest. These men did not comply. The experienced Czechoslovak Legion quickly seized control of the city and withstood both the attacks of Whites and Reds.  Faced with defeat, no other major offensives were launched against the Legion. This allowed the Legion to start its own assault. Right after seizing Kurgan from Red forces, the Legion faced a rebellion among its ranks, which made further advancement impossible.\n\nThe Legion came to know this city and its newfound poverty. To make things worse, the war had also taken its toll on the local peasants. Faced with the possibility of starvation, the Legion created an expeditionary regiment, mostly consisting of green Russian workers and a few supervising units. This regiment was sent to raid the territories of both Reds or Whites. At the expense of high russian casualties, the situation became more bearable with each raid…\n\nTruthfully, it was a miracle that the Legion did not collapse during its first years. With only occasional small scale food shortages, Chelyabinsk still stands as a functioning city. However, Gadja can't help but feel concerned,  since, according to the Legionaries council assessment, a dry summer would be all that it would take for a devastating famine..."

Situation has only worsened with time -  the Legion is more split than ever. Were it not for Gadjas infamous reputation when dealing with deserters, many would have followed the path of treason. Some are more influential than others, notably, Returnists - the old guard of czech and other european officers that joined the Legion during the Great War, the ever growing Russian faction, fueled by nationalist mission of reunification and the restoration of Russia's former glory. It is also worth mentioning the three ideological groups, the poetic futurists, the devout christians and the energetic pagans. Often in conflict with one another, the officers of the previously mentioned factions are currently aligned with Gadja, in hopes of convincing him that their vision for Russia and Slavs as a whole is the correct one.\n\nGadjas task is to navigate through political drama that plagues the Legionary Council.

As such, peoples opinions are split when it comes to deciding on one, single approach.\n\nThe Christian faction has been advocating for a modified model of socialism ,which could truly represent our peoples interests. They propose the development of a temporary national-bourgeois class, the education of peasantry, rural industrialization and centralization of armament production.\n\nThe Futurists want something quite different. Influenced by vague information gained from travelers, they applied Sorelianist policies to the situation that the Legion finds itself in: Creation of a government body that unites workers and employers in a symbiotic relationship by regulating production. The few remaining entrepreneurs have rallied behind this idea, improving the legitimacy of the Futurist proposal.\n\nLastly, we have the Pagans with an outrageous demand. They want to emulate the Slavic kingdoms of the past by creating a new ruling caste, which would govern over the state. Surprisingly, the Russian faction does not object to this and even seems to support it.\n\nThe voting starts."

While it seems to be the most popular proposal, some regard the idea of confederation with contempt, arguing that direct control of these substates would be more preferable. But probably the most insane idea is the creation of one singular to represent all Slavs west from Russia.

As most debates quickly degrade into profane name calling, they are quickly ended by Gadja. Instead, each speaker gave a brief summary of their position before voting.\n\nThe Christians are of the opinion that a Slav is not a cultural nor a ethnic identity, rather, it is a spirituality unique to the Slavic people. The origins of an individual hold no sway over ones "Slavness", as it is an identity that can be both earned and lost depending on the Individual.\n\n"The concepts of race and nation as we know it are too tribal and thus primitive for the man of today and tomorrow! An engine cannot function without its cogs, nuts and bolts. The same could be said about the state. An engine utilizes gears of foreign origin, provided they function. This engine is our nation, not some arbitrary shared origin."\n\nThe Pagans believe that the Slavs are a people tied together by blood, therefore they promote the idea that Slavs are a racial group.

 rob_poland.0.t:0 "Poland in 1934"
 rob_poland.0.d:0 "The Polish people have been fighting with their political enemies for centuries. The credit to their continued valorous strife goes to the patriotic few, who, despite the efforts of the Magnate and the Sejm, defeated Prussian and Russian forces in 1794. Kosciuszko became a Hero of the Nation, but more importantly, achieved 15 years of national rebirth. Their support of Napoleon led to their downfall, and in 1809, the Polish State was no more, having been partitioned once more. But the Poles did not forget those 15 years, and during the Revolution of 1905, Poland almost broke free from Russian rule. But today, Poland's long fight for independence has already ended.\n\nPoland was one of the few nations to come out of the Great War as a victor. Polish representatives managed to score multiple victories in the treaty of Versailles that followed the War's end, securing not only the Polish mainland, but also the disputed regions of Silesia and Lwów. 1923 saw multiple border regions seized in the East, as Polish forces intervened in the Russian Civil War. However, the Polish had underestimated the battle-fatigued Bolsheviks, and soon were pushed back through tactical mastery. In the course of the year of 1924, only Western Belarus was still under Polish jurisdiction, as the Red Army deemed its recapture an endeavor too costly. The Polish intervention was a failure, but the weakening of Bolshevik forces in Ukraine and Belarus allowed locals to rebel against the Red Army, kicking off both the Belarusian and Ukrainian Wars of Independence.\n\nThe effects of the great depression needs to be addressed as soon as possible, if Poland is to remain a regional powerhouse. Current government is in shambles, as its unofficial leader, Józef Piłsudski, having fathered Poland ever since her reemergence, has grown ill. Whispers can be heard in Sejm, wondering if the great man will soon depart. Some are awaiting the chance to edit the constitution, others to burn and the rest simply desire power. Only time will tell what the future holds…"

Despite this President Hoover managed a surprise victory in 1932 as he faced a tight election with New York’s progressive Governor Roosevelt. Hoover ran on continuing his efforts to fix the economy and comparing Roosevelt to the Communists in Germany who he claimed Red Roosevelt was soft on. Roosevelt was largely seen as too liberal for America as Hoover promised change. Many political pundits have speculated that Hoover campaigning on anti-communism is the only thing that kept him above water.    Hoover faces attacks from the Democrat Party from both Roosevelt and Huey Long who demand change and the end of a nearly two decade long Republican ‘misrule’. However, progressive Republicans have begun making small reforms which have so far kept Hoover relatively popular in the Northeast. Only time will tell if America will meet the same fate as Europe."
