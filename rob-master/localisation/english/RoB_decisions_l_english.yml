SPR_spanish_revanschism_desc:0 "Kingdom of Spain, led by a military junta, entered the Great War in September of 1914, after seeing German armies rapidly advancing into France again, under a rather childish delusion, that they were going to invade everyone else, and nobody was going to invade them. The fact was, that Spanish Army was in no way prepared for two front war against Portugal and France, while also dealing with total isolation due to naval blockades by Italian, British and French fleets and various internal rebellions by regional nationalists, liberals and socialists. \n\nSpain fell quickly, and surrendered to Entente forces in 16th of January, 1917, after united French and Portugese forces encircled Madrid. Peace treaty was harsh, punishing Spain for it's unexpected entry into the Great War. Spanish Monarchy was abolished, Portugal occupied Galicia, Catalonia and Basque Republic gained independece from Spain, and heavy regulations were pushed onto the Spanish people. \n\nNow, with the advent of a truly Spanish State, and destruction of the old, liberal status quo, Spain stands at crossroads, seeking to unite Iberia under their rule once more."
