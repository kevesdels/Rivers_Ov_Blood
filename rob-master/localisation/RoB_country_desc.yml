 LIT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Once a powerful Grand Duchy, the modern state of Lithuania is a shadow of its former self. It may be a conservative democracy with a decent size for such a small state, but it is far from perfect. There are enemies on all sides with Prussians and Baltic Germans on their borders, various nationalist factions wishing to bring back the days of old and the general fear for the future, Lithuania is in a very precarious position. But perhaps this may all change with the following years to come"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Forged from the ashes of the Russian empire, a communist front has created a large sovereign territory to establish a Russian workers state. Following the collapse would see years of famine and starvation alongside crippling military defeat. But even after all of these hardships the communists in the north have shown they are yet to give up their determination and loyalty to their ideals of Marx. Only time will tell the future of the Bolsheviks, but one thing for certain is they are not ready to go into the ashheaps of history without a fight."

However, as of 1934, they are standing alone, with no real foreign support. The Internal situation isn't any softer, with corruption and regular partisan attacks weaking the socialist grip on the country. Will worldwide socialism be build from the heart of Europe, or will it perish in the coming storm?"
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Cut off, weakened, and surrounded on all sides by enemies, the Army of Turkestan continued its fight against Russian, Afghan and Basmachi armies. Hugging the Caspian coastline, the army has now found itself thousands of miles from its nearest allies. With supplies running low, attrition from Basmachi raids, and the sudden reappearence of the exiled Ioseb Jughashvili, nobody knows where the future of the Turkestani Army lies now..."
