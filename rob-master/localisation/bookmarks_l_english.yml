 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Rivers Of Blood"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. In Europe, Hitler has consolidated his power and his attention is now increasingly drawn beyond Germany's borders. Mussolini's Italy continues to embark on daring military adventures, while the Empire of Japan stands poised to attack China in Asia. Almost twenty years have passed since the end of the Great War, and the world has yet again been doused in gasoline. A single spark may be all it takes."
 ###COUNTRY DESC
 LIT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Once a powerful Grand Duchy, the modern state of Lithuania is a shadow of its former self. It may be a conservative democracy with a decent size for such a small state, but it is far from perfect. There are enemies on all sides with Prussians and Baltic Germans on their borders, various nationalist factions wishing to bring back the days of old and the general fear for the future, Lithuania is in a very precarious position. But perhaps this may all change with the following years to come"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Forged from the ashes of the Russian empire, a communist front has created a large sovereign territory to establish a Russian workers state. Following the collapse would see years of famine and starvation alongside crippling military defeat. But even after all of these hardships the communists in the north have shown they are yet to give up their determination and loyalty to their ideals of Marx. Only time will tell the future of the Bolsheviks, but one thing for certain is they are not ready to go into the ashheaps of history without a fight."
 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Many claim that the Poland is a regional power in making. Possesing industry comparable to Western economies, yet remaining mainly agricultural allowed her to doge the worst of the Great Depression. A nationalist and militant, the threat of war is always on Poles mind. But as Pilsudkis health worsens, few can say if this trend will trully continue."
 LES_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Stuck in Siberia, with no way to get home, the Czechoslovak legion was forced to dig in. For almost two decades the Legionaries have not seen the landscapes of their fatherlands... Homesickness bread bitterness, and bitterness is what current head of the Legion, Gadja, knows how to use. But secretly, he has ambitions far greater than his comrades -  a Unified Slavdom."
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Having stood on the brink of defeat, the triumphant victor of the Great War enjoyed a decade of economic growth, now stopped by the Great Depression of 1930.  These few years have been harsh on the nation, causing many a Frenchman to hold Pelekist and Socialist sentiments. With the Republic stagnating, the likelihood of a rebellious uprising increases with each passing day."
 PRS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the dissolution of the government, communists fought hard to seize control of the state but there were many monarchists and reactionaries who wished to prevent a socialist takeover. The remnants of the anti-communist cause resides in Prussia under the regime of the Kaiser. 1871 saw the Prussian kingdom take over and unify all of Germany and now in 1934 they have been forced to flee to their ancestral homelands in Königsberg."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the Great War, Germany saw the defeat of reactionaries in German Civil War, and estabilshment of a new socialist state. However, as of 1934, they are standing alone, with no real foreign support. The Internal situation isn't any softer, with corruption and regular partisan attacks weaking the socialist grip on the country. Will worldwide socialism be build from the heart of Europe, or will it perish in the coming storm?"
 TRS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1920, the Red Army was decisively defeated at the Battle of Tsaritsyn, making way for a grand white counteroffensive in the south, retaking much of the Upper Caucasus, and even pushing as far as Saratov before being driven back. In addition, the hasty advance of the Whites resulted in the collapse of the Central Asian front, with troops being diverted to the Russian Mainland and increased attacks from the local Basmachi movement. Cut off from the main Red Army by Kazakh and Turkmen forces, the Red Army of Turkestan fled southward, where it remains to this day. But growing disunity among the locals may provide an oppertunity..."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "At these desperate times, everyone stands at crossroads. Only time will tell, who will perish, and who will prevail."
