FRAS_rob-france-start.28.d:0 "While the idea of a nationalistic and militaristic state does sound very appealing to many of the army’s more radical generals, the army decided to not side with the Pelekists. Rather they chose to stay loyal to the oath the took upon entering the French military. An oath of loyalty to preserv both the ideals of the republic and the republic itself. Those who stood against this ideal were removed and discharged from the military by the elites. With the army now almost purely in favor of the democratic government, the Pelekist cause now had no chance of any further radicalization of the current military."

FRAS_rob-france-start.29.d:0 "The communists have always been divided on how to unify France under socialism, but all of them together have unified in complete coalition against the banning of their political parties. It is said that self described “worker activist” Paul Ramadier hosted a meeting between various communist officials somewhere in the south of France. Leaders from all over the spectrum came to meet Mr. Ramadier in Paris. A crowd gathered around the Hôtel de Crillon where they met. Some supporters cheered on as party leaders entered the hotel while many others booed. Due to the meeting being a non political rally, it was deemed legal under the bill. However police were dispatched to break up any fights between radicals and to keep the police."

FRAS_rob-france-start.30.d:0 "In response to the failed vote to ban the communist parties and associations of France, various radical far right political groups met today at the Hôtel de Crillon to discuss further actions. Both parties originally had very different views on how to run a state. Sorelians claim that the Pelekists are overly nationalistic and theocratic, whereas the Pelekists claim that the Sorelenists will eventually lead to a communistic state. But today these groups put aside their differences to discuss their common enemy of the left wing. Both sides agree that the vote to ban the parties should have been passed if it was not for so called “liberal intervention”. As far as what was discussed in detail at this meeting, was yet to be publicized by either party."

FRAS_rob-france-start.31.d:0 "While the nationalist and right coalitions are dangerous, the left wing communistic parties are much more organized and have been seen as more “socially acceptable” by people who are against the current political situation. Which is why a new proposition of making these far left groups illegal has gained recent popularity in French parliament. The bill has also seen favoritism amongst both center and far right politicians and groups. \n\nIf the bill passes it will see a complete ban on any communistic or socialistic groups. Current accepted parties will be disbanded, and any new parities, rallies or far left wing activity will be met with shutdown by French law enforcement. Those against the bill may or may not agree with the communists, but they argue that suppression of political ideologies won’t fix the increasing radicalization. While those in favor claim that it is needed to protect us far left terror that threatens to destroy the French way of life. The out come is eventually reached and it appears…"

FRAS_rob-france-start.32.t:0 "Pelekists March on Paris!"
FRAS_rob-france-start.32.d:0 "Many of the members of right wing parties, including the far right Pelekist party are very upset and frustrated with the refusal to ban communist parties by the French government. As a result, a paramilitary branch known as the Gold Shirts was formed by the Pelekist party. These men, identifiable by their golden polos and shirts, have taken stocks of arms and distributed it amongst themselves forming militias all over the country. Even scarier though is that some military officials have even defected their posts and joined these hooligans. Claiming that the Pelekist cause cares more about the army than the government does or ever will. With the army nearly split between loyalists and Pelekists, the stage was set for complete political and military turmoil. In very early hours in the morning Gold Shirts and army defectors stormed various government buildings all over paris. Some Gold Shirts even flew the Pelekist party flag over the Eiffel Tower with the French flag being burned. \n\nThe army was called in to deal with the Pelekist foes but even with the loyalist armies, Pelekism is seen as more favorable by multiple generals, as it favors a militaristic state. This is something that the republic could never achieve amongst a democratic society. This could either be a chaotic riot by some far right extremists, or the beginning of a Pelekist French state."

FRAS_rob-france-start.33.d:0 "The Great War was a hard fought victory for the French people. Despite having nearly lost all of Paris, the French and allied forces pushed through Alsace and started a new offensive against the German war machine. Just because the French tri-color flew heroicallyover their captured German lands, the victory itself was much more hollow than it appeared to their western counterparts.\n\n Since the end of the conflicts, the French administration has seen a growing number of political radicalization. Both far left and far right groups have grown popularity en mass and it has begun to threaten both the people of France as well as the ideals of democracy which have been held so dear since the French Revolution. Some of these groups claim to be the champion of the workers and wish to revive the ideas of the Paris Commune from years before. Others wish to realize French identity and wish to see a rise of a new French empire. Either way, both of these radical political ideologies wish to dismantle the existing French democratic system. \n\nWith one of their greatest rivals, Germany, divided and humiliated France appeared to have the upper hand as far as a dominant power in mainland Europe. But after such recent political turmoil, it is unsure how long, or if France will continue to hold this title."
