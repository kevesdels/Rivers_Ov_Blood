THR_rob_thr.15.t:0 "The Situation In Austria"
THR_rob_thr.15.d:0 "The situation in Austria is a peculiar one. After the war our monarch was exiled and attempted two times to become monarch of the Hungarians, ending up being successful on the second attempt. This ended in a complete Serbo-Romanian occupation of Hungary with Otto being killed in a anti-monarchist coup. With the end of the war, Germany was consumed by the fires of a people's revolution, leading to a refugee crisis in Austria, with many freikorps members and their families coming here in order to rebuild German forces in an attempt to save the German people."

THR_rob_thr.16.d:0 "The communist influences in our country along with nationalist movements has caused quite the civil conflict, with all sides armed with pre war weapons' and leading powerful paramilitaries in the name of ideology. Eventually in order to bring stability to our nation the fatherland front and the heimswher coup'd the government, replacing it's democracy with a reactionary Christian dictatorship. This of course only has led to tensions between all parties rising even further."
THR_rob_thr.16.a:0 "Who are these parties?"
THR_rob_thr.17.t:0 "The Parties"
THR_rob_thr.17.d:0 "Opposed to the Fatherland front, a Mr "Adolf" has created a bloc of national socialists, filled with a diverse cast of ideologically different people, with some rumors even dabbling in the occult. And opposed to both groups are RotKorps, a anarchic group of communists with various amounts of radical beliefs, ranging from a libral socialist society to a full individualist collectivized state."

THR_rob_thr.18.d:0 "A few National Socialist rogues, under Fridolin Glass have decided they would go on their own to overthrow our government. Though they ended in failure, this doesn't bode well as many on the political spectrum are picking up arms, viewing that the government will begin to crackdown on them."

THR_rob_thr.19.d:0 "In 1920, the hotel, restaurant and cinema became the property of the Upper Austrian Social Democratic Workers' Party of Austria (SDAPÖ). The existing facilities were now augmented with the offices of the Linz SDP party secretariat, a library and reading room. Thus with the recent coup event and the crackdown, our chief of police has decided to raid this den of communism, leading to a shootout between the police and the communist scum. Alas, due to this many are taking arms against us and preparing for the inevitable, civil war."

About 30,000 were shot by SA. Prison burning. Hardly 20% of Hungarian intelligentsia has remained. Some elements of the Gömbös-group (2) under the direction of Istvan and Gula have organized a militia force and a municipal office. The Einsatzgruppe has created a counterbalance to the Gömbös group, a Hungarian self-policed city administration. Further measures against the Gömbös-group, in particular against Gömbös himself, are in preparation. They will be carried out as soon as possible.\n\nEK 4a and EK 4b with Einsatzgruppe staff have also arrived in Budapest."
THR_rob_thr.25.t:0 "Victory, Finally?"
THR_rob_thr.25.d:0 ""Berlin is left in ruins, dead bodies lay everywhere in the streets. Death squads can be seen lead captured soldiers and Jews to their final destination outside the city. Pillars and arches of the Reichstag lay bare in the street as along with a beheaded statue of Marx. A car's door opens, Ernst Rohm steps one foot out. Berlin has been taken, the Reichstag is his, laying bare in front of him in it's ruined state. He walks forward, his feet lifting off one marble stair step onto another. Finally out of breath he is at the door of the Reichstag. With his guards right next to him he grasp the handle on the doors, feeling the cold metal which had been abused by the hands communists for so long. He pulls the doors to the Reichstag open. Letting in blinding light, creating a shining aura around Rohm and his most loyal SA men. Leading Rohm guarding him through the abandoned halls; Rohm walks forward ever so briskly with a smirk stretched upon his face. Finally they entire a massive auditorium like room, on each side of Rohm are empty chancellery chairs, left vacant after the communist Jews we're finally expunged from the heart of Germany. He continues walking down to the chair of the dead VolksPrezident and sits down. Grasping the armrests of the chairs he sits down, allowing a feeling of awesome warmth pass through him. He has won, Germany is his, his people saved.""
